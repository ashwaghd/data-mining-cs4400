But making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d still led to some places that neither Williams, Neville or Lego could foresee.\u201cWe did have extensive conversations about how wide a back of a bikini bottom would be on a minifig in a \u2018Rump Shaker\u2019 video,\u201d says Neville, chuckling. \u201cWe had many discussions about things I thought I would never be talking about as a filmmaker.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d did not come with any easy-to-assemble instructions. It\u2019s part music biopic, part documentary, part family film. It is, like many things about Williams\u2019 hit-making life, radiant with uplift, beats and idiosyncrasy. \n\u201cSociety likes to put us in boxes, pun intended,\u201d Williams says, speaking alongside Neville. \u201cHere was a moment where this guy\u2019s view of my life and the way he saw it strung together was incredibly liberating for me. While I\u2019ve never seen myself in a box, this helps other people now to, as well.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d which Focus Features releases in theaters Friday, begins, like many documentaries, with the director, Neville, sitting down with a camera crew focused on their subject, Williams. But in this case, Williams \u2014 and everything else, including a bearded, bespectacled Neville \u2014 are Lego.\n\u201cWhat if we told my life with Legos?\u201d Williams asks in the film. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen,\u201d replies Neville.\nWhat follows is something like a traditional documentary complete with colorful recounting of past struggles and triumphs, from his upbringing in Virginia Beach to his string of chart-topping hits, told through Williams\u2019 voiceover and a number of talking heads. It was recorded that way in interviews, either on camera, Zoom or phone, and then animated into Lego form. Here, finally, is a chance to see Busta Rhymes as a Lego, along with many others, including Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.\n\u201cThe first meeting we had was with Lego because if they had said no, there would have been no film,\u201d says Neville, the director of documentaries including \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cWon't You Be My Neighbor\u201d and \u201cSteve!\u201d \u201cTo their credit, they not only said yes, but I think understood the kind of growth it would force them into.\u201d\nFor Lego, the Danish toy company, making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was its biggest gamble since stepping into feature films with 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Lego Movie.\u201d Neville approached the company\u2019s head of global entertainment, Jill Wilfert with a pitch for what would be Lego\u2019s first foray into a documentary not about itself. Wilfert was immediately responsive.\n\u201cThe whole idea behind Lego is its endless creativity and limitless possibility, and Pharrell really kind of embodies that,\u201d she says.\nAs proof of concept, Neville put together a 90-second video of Williams reflecting on his upbringing and the inspiration of artists like Stevie Wonder. (A vinyl of \u201cSongs in the Key of Life\u201d is another one of those things you never expected to see as a Lego.)\n\u201cI came away from that saying, \u2018This is totally going to work,\u2019\u201d Neville says. \u201cAnd everybody we showed it to got it. They were like: I want to see this movie.\u201d\nStill, Neville and Williams knew the Lego approach would mean working within PG parameters. Some things about Williams\u2019 life \u2014 like being young and famous while operating in the upper echelons of pop and hip-hop \u2014 wouldn\u2019t fit in a family-friendly movie. Williams says the movie \u201cparaphrases\u201d his life.\n\u201cThere were definitely some areas that weren\u2019t within my expectations of where we might go,\u201d Wilfert says. \u201cWe had a lot of good dialogue throughout the whole process. Morgan and Pharrell, there was mutual respect because we are a brand that people have high expectations of and expect certain things of. So we did work with them on areas that we felt did make sense and didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nIt also pushed Lego in other ways. Williams is particularly proud that the movie led to Lego expanding its available skin tones and hair textures. Williams\u2019 Lego self \u2014 which he carried proudly to the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d \u2014 was specifically designed to match his own skin tone.\n\u201cYou name the type of human being, we fought hard for their existence and acknowledgement,\u201d says Williams. \u201cLego obliged and I think the brand is better because of it.\u201d\nOne of the movie\u2019s most clever designs is illustrating tracks that Williams crafts himself or in collaboration, like Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d Gwen Stefani\u2019s \u201cHollaback Girl,\u201d Nelly\u2019s \u201cHot in Herre\u201d or Pharrell\u2019s own \u201cHappy.\u201d Each is rendered as a unique little glowing set of Legos pieced together.\nOther, less happy aspects of Williams\u2019 life don\u2019t make the cut. You won\u2019t see anything about the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d lawsuit, in which Marvin Gaye\u2019s estate sued for copyright infringement and won. Nor is there anything in the film about Williams\u2019 recent legal squabbles with his Neptunes co-founder Chad Hugo. Earlier this year, Hugo filed a trademark opposition over the duo\u2019s name, claiming Williams\u2019 \u201cfraudulently\u201d sought control of it. Representatives for Williams have disagreed, saying Williams \u201creached out on multiple occasions to share in the ownership.\u201d\n\u201cPiece By Piece,\u201d though, does include a positive portrayal of Hugo, particularly in Williams\u2019 early days in Virginia Beach, when the two began making music together.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bittersweet. I\u2019m so grateful for my experiences. Chad is an integral part of the beginning, the genesis of my pursuit in music and being there,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI met him in the second grade in band class, and the memories that we have of making music together, I would not be sitting here if it weren\u2019t for us meeting.\u201d\nWilliams, who is Men\u2019s Creative Director for Louis Vuitton, is talented when it comes to brand management. He released his debut solo album, \u201cIn My Mind,\u201d in 2006 and long ago stepped into the spotlight, himself. But he has, by his own acknowledgement, remained a producer at heart. Not everything about \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was easy for him.\n\u201cA lot of that was vulnerable for me,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, crying two times in the story. I hadn\u2019t considered he might ask questions that would trigger emotion. I\u2019m such a produced person. I\u2019ve produced myself so much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that Neville, as a protean documentarian used to adapting to the style and attitude of his subjects, can relate to.\n\u201cPharrell as a producer is often holding up a mirror to artists to get them to see themselves. My job is to hold up a mirror to him to get him to see himself,\u201d Neville says. \u201cI feel like, in an odd way, we have the same job.\u201d\nWhen Neville interviewed other musicians for the film, he told them that they\u2019d be animated. But he didn\u2019t say how. It was only later they found out they\u2019d be Lego minifigs.\n\u201cEveryone was so shocked and so elated,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI feel like it released the inner child in all of them. Some of them look at life that way, anyways. Other ones, even the tough guys, were like, \u2018Oh, man, this is so cool.\u2019\u201d\nCapturing Williams\u2019 life in a playful, even childlike way will surely help some younger viewers connect to his story. Becoming a world-famous multi-hyphenate might seem out of reach to most, but \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d makes it look, almost, like a snap.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/cbs-news-trump-campaign-shifting-explanations-snubbed-60-114617380", "Title": "CBS News says Trump campaign had 'shifting explanations' for why he snubbed '60 Minutes'", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:12 PM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- CBS News said the Trump campaign offered \u201cshifting explanations\u201d for why it backed out of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview special with presidential candidates that aired without him.The network's Scott Pelley appeared on the air Monday night to explain why Republican Donald Trump did not appear on what has become a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d tradition: back-to-back interviews with presidential candidates in the last month of the campaign.\nHarris was on the show, interviewed by Bill Whitaker. Where Trump was supposed to appear, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d instead aired a story about an Arizona official pushing false claims about election fraud.\nPelley said that the Trump campaign \u201ccomplained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story.\u201d\nThe Trump team also demanded an apology for his interview during the 2020 campaign, where he claimed that correspondent Lesley Stahl said a laptop computer belonging to President Joe Biden's son Hunter came from Russia. \u201cShe never said that,\u201d Pelley said.\nPelley said that Trump's team had agreed to an interview at the former president's Mar-a-Lago home, with an additional talk in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he returned to the scene of a July assassination attempt.\nTrump spokesman Steven Cheung said \u201c60 Minutes\u201d \u201cbegged for an interview.\u201d The campaign did have concerns about the show's reporting on Hunter Biden and how it insisted upon editing Trump's comments, he said.\n\u201cThere was nothing scheduled or agreed upon,\" Cheung said. \u201dWe had already long promised an exclusive in filming at Butler to another national outlet, which turned out the be Fox News.\"\nTrump's interview with Fox's Laura Ingraham aired an hour before \"60 Minutes\" on Monday night. His absence from CBS was not mentioned in their exchange. Trump apparently, watched, however, posting on Truth Social that the Harris interview \u201cis considered by many of those who reviewed it, the WORST interview they have ever seen.\u201d\nPelley poked at Trump, noting he had already turned down another opportunity to debate Harris, along with the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, \u201cwhich may have been the largest audience for the candidates between now and election day.\u201d\nMoving \u201c60 Minutes\u201d out of its traditional Sunday time slot may have depressed the audience size, however. An estimated 5.4 million people watched on Monday, according to preliminary Nielsen company figures, compared with the 9.6 million who saw the newsmagazine on Sunday, Sept. 29.\nNo estimate for Trump's audience on Ingraham's show was immediately available. Her show averaged 2.7 million viewers a night last week, Nielsen said.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/mlb-air-local-games-guardians-brewers-twins-beginning-114617288", "Title": "MLB will air local games for Guardians, Brewers and Twins next season", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:51 PM", "Content": "Major League Baseball announced Tuesday it will produce and distribute local broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins next year. All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, also announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.\nThe addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025.\nMLB took over broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2023 season and the Colorado Rockies this year.\nRick Schlesinger, the president of business operations for the Brewers, said he expects more teams could be partnering with MLB by the opening of next season.\n\u201cThis has been a long process. It\u2019s a very deliberative process,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve done this through a lot of work, a lot of analysis. I think this is going to be a huge game changer for us, for our content.\u201d\nBy taking over the broadcasts, MLB expects to increase the market reach of its teams by at least 2 million households in each market. The Diamondbacks went from being available in 930,000 households on a regional sports network to 5.6 million homes through a combination of being on local cable systems, satellite and direct-to-consumer streaming.\n\u201cWith the media landscape continuing to evolve, Major League Baseball is committed to serving our fans by ensuring they can see their favorite clubs, removing blackouts where we can, and ultimately growing the reach of our games,\u201d Noah Garden, MLB deputy commissioner for business and media, said in a statement.\nThe Twins took a public relations hit in Minnesota for cutting their 2024 player payroll coming off a division title and their first postseason series win in 22 years, in light of the reduced rights fee coming from Diamond. They will lose the rights fee altogether with this MLB-produced model, but team president Dave St. Peter said this announcement would not have an effect on player spending for the upcoming season.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time with Major League Baseball trying to better understand this marketplace, trying to better understand what a model like this will ultimately provide to the team. We also have studied closely what\u2019s happened in San Diego, in Arizona and in Colorado. We\u2019ve gotten comfortable in those economics. They are where they are,\" St. Peter said.\n\"We do expect that there will be a reduction in local revenue coming to the Twins in 2025. I think that\u2019s a fact. That said, over the long haul we have tremendous confidence in our content and believe, while maybe we\u2019ll take a dip for \u201925, that over time the viewership and those economics related to that viewership will increase.\u201d\nCleveland games were available on approximately 1.45 million households on its regional sports network. That reach is expected to increase 235% to 4.86 million households. Minnesota's will go up 307% from 1.08 million homes to 4.4 million.\nSchlesinger said the Brewers had 800,000 households that could receive games this past season, but he also expects to see significant growth with the new model.\n\u201cFrom a fan perspective, it\u2019s great because you\u2019re going to have total access and no blackouts,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of staffing, a lot of infrastructure, a lot of decisions have to be made, a lot of people to be hired, a lot of sponsors to contact. This is the right time to do this. It\u2019s a good jumping point, platform to make sure when the calendar turns to 2025, we\u2019re already fully immersed in this and that we know when the first game starts, that we\u2019re ready to go and the product\u2019s going to be outstanding.\u201d\nMLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond Sports Group continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings. The nation's largest owner of regional sports networks could be down to doing only Atlanta Braves games in 2025.\nThe operator of the Bally Sports regional networks presented its reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston last week. As part of the reorganization, Diamond plans to void the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays and to attempt to rework the deals of the five franchises that are partial owners of their regional sports networks \u2014 the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.\nSt. Peter said he expects more teams to sign onto the model in the future.\n\u201cStarting to build that direct-to-consumer foundation, which clearly is the future of the way our games will be distributed \u2014 it\u2019s time to get on with that and we\u2019re excited about that,\u201d St. Peters said. \u201cOur ownership understands the consequences of that, but I think over time there\u2019s way more upside than short-term downside.\u201d\nA final hearing on Diamond's reorganization plan is scheduled for Nov. 14. Diamond also has the rights to 13 NBA and eight NHL teams.\nDiamond Sports Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019. Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s film and television assets to be approved.\n___\nAP sports writers Dave Campbell in Minneapolis and Steve Megargee in Milwaukee contributed to this story.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/mlb-air-local-games-cleveland-milwaukee-minnesota-beginning-114616889", "Title": "MLB will air local games for Cleveland, Milwaukee and Minnesota beginning next season", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:47 PM", "Content": "Video\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/interview-tough-cbs-news-grappling-question-after-dokoupil-114615670", "Title": "When is an interview too tough? CBS News grappling with question after Dokoupil interview", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:31 PM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- Television morning show interviews often don't stray beyond dinner recipes or celebrity hijinks. Yet a week after it took place, CBS News host Tony Dokoupil's pointed interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates about Israel remains the subject of heated conversations at the network and beyond.CBS management took the unusual step of scolding Dokoupil before his colleagues for not living up to network standards, in a private meeting Monday that quickly became public, and \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d staff continued to discuss it on Tuesday.\nThe seven-minute interview on Sept. 30 was about Coates' new book of essays, and Dokoupil zeroed in right away on a section about Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank in an exchange the Washington Post last week called \u201cunusually tense and substantive.\u201d\nFor all of Coates\u2019 honors as a writer, Dokoupil said that the essay \u201cwould not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist.\u201d He wondered why Coates\u2019 writing did not include references to Israel being surrounded by enemies that want to eliminate the country.\n\u201cIs it because you just don\u2019t believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?\u201d he asked.\nCoates said there was no shortage of places where Israel's viewpoint is represented, and that he wanted to speak for those who don't have a voice.\n\u201cI wrote a 260-page book,\u201d Coates said. \u201cIt is not a treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.\u201d\nDokoupil later asked Coates about what offended him about the existence of a Jewish state, and he said that Palestinians \u201cexist in your narrative merely as victims of Israel,\u201d as if they had not been offered peace in any juncture. \nCoates said that he was offended when anyone \u2014 including the Palestinians who talked to him for his book \u2014 are treated as second-class citizens in the country where they live, comparing it to the Jim Crow-era United States where his ancestors grew up.\nIn the staff call on Monday, CBS News chief Wendy McMahon and her deputy, Adrienne Roark, said several journalists in the company had reached out to them about the interview.\n\u201cThere are times we have not met our editorial standards,\u201d Roark said, citing Dokoupil's interviews and other comments made by CBS personnel that she did not identify.\nCBS News is built on a \u201cfoundation of neutrality,\u201d she said. \u201cOur job is to serve our audience without bias or perceived bias.\u201d\nShe said that the problems had been addressed, but neither she nor CBS explained what this meant.\nMcMahon told staff members on the call that she expected its contents would remain confidential. But a tape of it was posted within hours on The Free Press news site.\nDokoupil did not immediately return messages seeking comment. A spokesman for Coates did not return a message.\nDokoupil is one of three \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d hosts, along with Gayle King and Nate Burleson. All three participated in the interview with Coates, but with the exception of an opening question by Burleson and a brief one at the end by King, it was dominated by Dokoupil.\nDokoupil is married to NBC News journalist Katy Tur. He has two children from a previous marriage who both live with their mother in Israel. In the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, Dokoupil said on the show that, \u201cas a father, I think people can understand if somebody, anybody, is firing rockets in the direction of your children without regard to whether they are struck or not, you're going to feel a thing or two.\u201d\nThe rebuke by CBS management Monday came on the first anniversary of the Hamas attack.\nManagement received immediate pushback on the call from Jan Crawford, CBS News' chief legal correspondent, who said that it's a journalist's obligation to ask tough questions when somebody comes on the air to present a one-sided view.\n\u201cI don't see how we can say that failed to meet our editorial standards,\u201d Crawford said. She said she worried that it would make her think twice when conducting interviews.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/disney-world-universal-orlando-remain-open-ahead-hurricane-114604792", "Title": "Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld will all close ahead of Milton", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:36 PM", "Content": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Orlando\u2019s tourism machine began grinding to a halt Tuesday with at least three major theme parks and the main airport announcing closures ahead of Hurricane Milton \u2019s expected hit as a major storm in Florida.Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando and SeaWorld will close their theme parks and respective entertainment facilities on Wednesday, with the latter two also closed on Thursday and Disney likely to remain closed.\nUniversal also canceled Halloween Horror Nights scheduled for both days.\nThe theme parks join Orlando International Airport, which said it would cease operations Wednesday morning. The airport is the nation\u2019s seventh busiest and Florida\u2019s most trafficked.\nDisney World had said earlier in the day that it was open and planned only to close its campgrounds and rental cabins ahead of the storm.\nThe only indication at Disney Springs that a hurricane was coming had been the closure of a hot air balloon ride. \u201cClosed due to hurricane,\u201d an electronic sign read. \u201cStay safe.\u201d\nAll the other stores and restaurants in the outdoor shopping, dining and entertainment complex inside the resort were open and doing brisk business.\nMilton, which is expected to come ashore Wednesday, threatened to ruin the vacations of tens of thousands of tourists at Disney World. \nNicole and Zeb Downs arrived on Monday after a 21-hour drive from Arkansas, expecting a 12-day Florida vacation with their three young sons. By Tuesday afternoon, they were contemplating packing up their car and heading back.\n\u201cWe are disappointed but it\u2019s kind of out of our hands at this point,\u201d said Zeb Downs as he strolled with his family along a still-bustling Disney Springs shopping and restaurant district at the park resort.\nNeither of them had experienced a hurricane before and weren\u2019t sure they wanted to try it.\nThe Orlando area is the most visited destination in the United States due to Disney World, Universal Orlando Resort and other theme parks, attracting 74 million tourists last year alone. \nOctober is also among the busier times for theme parks because of Halloween-related celebrations, which have become major money generators over the past couple decades.

A check of Disney World\u2019s online reservation system on Tuesday morning showed no vacancies.\nThose lucky enough to get a hotel reservation have gotten unexpected treats during past storms. During Hurricane Irma in 2017, guests at a hotel on Disney property found themselves stranded with actor Kristen Bell, who voiced the role of Anna in the beloved Disney film \u201cFrozen.\u201d While in Orlando, the actor found time to sing songs for evacuees at a nearby hurricane shelter.\nOnce a hurricane passes, the theme parks try to return operations to normal as quickly as possible. After Hurricane Charley charted a devastating path through Orlando in 2004, Disney World had utility vehicles picking up downed tree limbs and clearing roads on its property within an hour in the pitch-dark night.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/las-vegas-blow-kiss-goodbye-literally-tropicana-flashy-114605443", "Title": "Las Vegas will blow a kiss goodbye \u2014 literally \u2014 to the Tropicana with a flashy casino implosion", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:11 PM", "Content": "LAS VEGAS -- Sin City will quite literally blow a kiss goodbye to the Tropicana before first light Wednesday in an elaborate implosion that will reduce to rubble the last true mob building on the Las Vegas Strip.The Tropicana's hotel towers are expected to tumble in 22 seconds at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. The celebration will include a fireworks display and drone show.\nIt will be the first implosion in nearly a decade for a city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much a part of its identity as gambling itself.\n\u201cWhat Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they\u2019ve turned many of these implosions into spectacles,\u201d said Geoff Schumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob Museum. \nFormer casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes.\nFrom then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing.\nThe city hasn't blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion.\nThis time, the implosion will clear land for a $1.5 billion baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city's latest rebrand into a sports hub. \nThat will leave only the Flamingo from the city\u2019s mob era on the Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo's original structures are long gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s.\nThe Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April after welcoming guests for 67 years.\nOnce known as the \u201cTiffany of the Strip\u201d for its opulence, it was a frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore.\nIt opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into two wings.\nAs Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In 1979, the casino\u2019s beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass ceiling was installed above the casino floor.\nThe Tropicana's original low-rise hotel wings survived the many renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the Strip.\nBehind the scenes of the casino\u2019s grand opening, the Tropicana had ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank Costello.\nCostello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana\u2019s debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper in his coat pocket with the Tropicana's exact earnings figure, revealing the mob's stake in the casino.\nBy the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions.\nIts implosion on Wednesday will be streamed live and televised by local news stations.\nThere will be no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage Vegas relic.\n\u201cOld Vegas, it\u2019s going,\u201d Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the locks went on the doors.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/us-audiobooks-top-10-114603002", "Title": "US-Audiobooks-Top-10", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:05 PM", "Content": "Nonfiction 1.

The Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book, which is due out next week.\nTrump denied the reporting in an interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl. \u201cHe\u2019s a storyteller. A bad one. And he\u2019s lost his marbles,\u201d Trump said of Woodward.\nTrump had previously spoken to Woodward for the journalist's 2021 book, \u201cRage.\u201d Trump later sued over it, claiming Woodward never had permission to publicly release recordings of their interviews for the book. The publisher and Woodward denied his allegations.\nHere is more from the new book:\nWoodward reports that Trump asked an aide to leave his office at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, so that the former president could have a private call with Putin in early 2024. The aide, whom Woodward doesn\u2019t name, said there have been multiple calls between Trump and Putin since Trump left office, perhaps as many as seven, according to the book, though it does not detail what they discussed.\nTrump senior adviser and longtime aide Jason Miller told Woodward that he had not heard Trump was having calls with Putin and said, \u201cI'd push back on that.\u201d But Miller also said, according to the book, \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d know how to get in touch with each other.\"\nSteven Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director, said none of the stories in Woodward\u2019s books are true. In a statement on Tuesday, he called them \u201cthe work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\u201d\nTrump's relationship with Putin has been scrutinized since his 2016 campaign for president, when he memorably called on Russia to find and make public missing emails deleted by Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d he said.\nU.S. intelligence agencies later determined that Russia had meddled in the 2016 election to help Trump, though an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller found no conspiracy between the Trump team and Russia. In 2018, Trump publicly questioned that finding following an in-person meeting with Putin in Helsinki.\nIn recent years, Trump has criticized U.S. support for Ukraine as it fights off Russia\u2019s invasion. He has said Ukraine should have made concessions to Putin before Russia invaded in 2022. He also previously touted his good relationship with Putin and called the Russian leader \u201cpretty smart\u201d for invading Ukraine.\nWoodward reports that Trump sent Putin COVID-19 test machines for his personal use as the virus began spreading in 2020.\nPutin told Trump not to tell anyone because people would be mad at Trump over it, but Trump said he didn\u2019t care if anyone knew, according to the book. Trump ended up agreeing not to tell anyone.\nThe book doesn\u2019t specify when the machines were sent but describes it as being when the virus spread rapidly through Russia. It was previously reported by The Associated Press and other agencies that Trump\u2019s administration in May 2020 sent ventilators and other equipment to several countries, including Russia.\nVice President Kamala Harris, in an interview Tuesday with radio host Howard Stern, accused Trump of giving the machines to a \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d at a time when \u201ceveryone was scrambling\" to get tests. \n\u201cThis person who wants to be president again, who secretly is helping out an an adversary while the American people are dying by the hundreds every day,\" said Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.\nThe book also details Biden\u2019s complicated relationship with Netanyahu as well as private moments when the president has been fed up with him over the Israel-Hamas war.\nBiden\u2019s \u201cfrustrations and distrust\u201d of Netanyahu \u201cerupted\u201d this past spring, Woodward writes. The president privately unleashed a profanity-laden tirade, calling him a \u201cson of a bitch\u201d and a \u201cbad f\u2014\u2014\u2014 guy,\" according to the book. Biden said he felt, in Woodward\u2019s accounting, that Netanyahu \u201chad been lying to him regularly.\u201d With Netanyahu \u201ccontinuing to say he was going to kill every last member of Hamas.\u201d Woodward wrote, \u201cBiden had told him that was impossible, threatening both privately and publicly to withhold offensive U.S. weapons shipment.\u201d\nBiden and Netanyahu have long been acquainted, although their relationship has not been known to be close or overly friendly. Last week, Biden said he didn\u2019t know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a Mideast peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\nAsked about the book's reporting, White House spokesperson Emilie Simons told reporters Tuesday that \u201cThe commitment that we have to the state of Israel is ironclad.\u201d\nSimons, when pressed on the details, said she wouldn't comment on every anecdote that may come out in reporting. She added of Biden and Netanyahu: \u201cThey have a long-term relationship. They have a very honest and direct relationship, and I don\u2019t have a comment on those specific anecdotes.\u201d\nThe book details Biden\u2019s criticism late last year of President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of Putin\u2019s earlier invasion of Ukraine, when Russia seized Crimea and a section of the Donbas in 2014, at a time when Biden was serving as the Democrat\u2019s vice president.\n\u201cThey f----- up in 2014,\u201d Woodward wrote that Biden said to a close friend in December, blaming the lack of action for Putin\u2019s actions in Ukraine. \u201cBarack never took Putin seriously.\u201d\nBiden was angry while speaking to the friend and said they \u201cnever should have let Putin just walk in there\u201d in 2014 and that the U.S. \u201cdid nothing.\u201d\nWoodward reports Biden was privately furious with Attorney General Merrick Garland for appointing a special counsel to investigate Biden\u2019s son Hunter in a tax-and-gun prosecution.\n\u201cShould never have picked Garland,\u201d Biden told an associate, according to Woodward. The journalist did not name the associate.\nHunter Biden was convicted in June on federal gun charges and faces sentencing in federal court in Delaware in December. He pleaded guilty to federal tax charges in California and is also set to be sentenced in that case in December.\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\nOne of Trump\u2019s longest-term allies, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, blamed Trump\u2019s ongoing false claims that the 2020 election was rigged to a cult of personality in which the former president\u2019s ensconcement at Mar-a-Lago and circle of aides and advisers \u201cconstantly feed this narrative,\u201d according to the book. \nThe weekend after Russia invaded Ukraine, Graham was with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, which the senator characterized as \u201ca little bit like going to North Korea.\u201d Graham added that \u201ceverybody stands up and claps every time Trump comes in.\u201d\nOn politics, Woodward wrote that Graham\u2019s counsel was part of what persuaded Trump to run again for the presidency.\nIn March, during one of his many visits to the Middle East since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Graham told Woodward that he had been meeting with the Saudi crown prince when Graham suggested they call Trump. From \u201ca bag containing about 50 burner phones,\u201d Prince Mohammed \u201cpulled out one labeled \u2018TRUMP 45.\u2019\u201d On another trip, Woodward wrote, the Saudi leader retrieved another burner phone, \"this time labeled JAKE SULLIVAN \u201d when the men called Biden\u2019s national security adviser.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/apple-tv-app-top-movies-114603001", "Title": "Apple TV app - Top Movies", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:00 PM", "Content": "Top Movie Purchases and Rentals (US):1.

CNN news anchor Chris Wallace starts the book in January 1960, when U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts declared his candidacy for the presidency during a divided time in United States politics. We are introduced to mobsters, Hollywood movie stars, labor bosses and Cuba's revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.\nIt was the year that U.S. presidential campaigns entered the modern era, with televised debates and slick advertising, The achingly close contest was not unlike the current lead-up to the 2024 election pitting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald Trump.\nLike now, there were charges of voter fraud and a stolen election. The results were so tight that Americans stayed up well past midnight to hear the final count.\nThe book is the latest in Wallace's \u201cCountdown\u201d series of popular histories, following his best-selling \u201cCountdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Changed the World,\u201d and \u201cCountdown bin Laden: The Untold Story of the 247-Day Hunt to Bring the Mastermind of 9/11 to Justice.\u201d\nThis time, Wallace, the son of CBS broadcaster Mike Wallace, takes us behind the scenes to view the machinations of the 1960 Democratic National Convention that led to Kennedy's nomination over Lyndon B. Johnson, later chosen as his running mate. Kennedy went on to become the first Catholic and youngest person elected U.S. president. \nKennedy narrowly defeated Republican Richard M. Nixon, who ultimately decided not to contest the results despite reports of voting irregularities in Illinois and Texas. He said he could not think of a worse example for young nations trying to adopt free elections. \nAs we approach another consequential election this year, the book is a reminder of how 1960 was also a deeply perilous time for America. It also was a moment the nation survived because of patriotism and courage.\n___\nAP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/qantas-airways-apologizes-after-rated-film-reportedly-airs-114601066", "Title": "Qantas Airways apologizes after R-rated film reportedly airs on every screen during flight", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 11:12 AM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- Qantas Airways has drawn up a stir after broadcasting a slightly-racy movie across an entire flight.

As a result, the crew chose one movie to play across all screens \u201cbased on the request from a number of passengers,\" the company said.\nQantas did not identify the movie by name, but several media outlets have reported that it was \u201cDaddio,\" an R-rated film that hit theaters earlier this year.\n\u201cDaddio\" follows a woman (Dakota Johnson) who takes a cab from JFK airport and strikes up an extended conversation with her driver (Sean Penn) on her way back home to Manhattan \u2014 as the two discuss anything from what it takes to be a New Yorker to relationships and infidelity, notably her current affair with a married man. The film carries an R rating for \u201clanguage throughout, sexual material and brief graphic nudity.\u201d\nSocial media posts from users who claim they were on the Qantas flight said they were uncomfortable by nudity and sexting featured in the film \u2014 particularly for families and children who were on board. Two users on Reddit said that it was also impossible for individual passengers to turn off the movie.\nAfter determining that the movie was not appropriate for all ages, the Qantas crew attempted to fix screens for travelers who did not want to watch it \u2014 but later found that this was not possible and changed course.\n\u201cThe movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience,\" a Qantas spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAll screens were changed to a family friendly movie for the rest of the flight, which is our standard practice for the rare cases where individual movie selection isn\u2019t possible.\u201d\nThe spokesperson added that Qantas is \u201creviewing how the (inital) movie was selected.\u201d\nIn the days following the incident, the airline has taken some flack online \u2014 including from travel rivals. \n\u201cPlot twist: We let you choose your movies,\u201d Air New Zealand wrote in a reply to the news on social media platform X.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/after-years-finding-rock-roll-hall-fame-cold-114598917", "Title": "After years of finding the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame cold as ice, Foreigner now knows what love is", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 10:52 AM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- This month, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame rectifies a wrong that many rock fans will celebrate with their lighters up in the air \u2014 the band Foreigner will finally be welcomed in.The English-American rockers \u2014 with hits like \u201cCold as Ice,\u201d \u201cHot Blooded\u201d and \u201cWaiting for a Girl Like You\" \u2014 topped the charts in the 1970s and \u201980s but never made it into the hall \u2014 much less a ballot \u2014 until last year, despite being eligible for more than 20 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a long wait and I know that we\u2019ve done enough in our career to warrant induction,\u201d says Al Greenwood, keyboardist and a founding member. \u201cI\u2019m not bitter about it. I mean, we\u2019re finally getting in and that\u2019s great.\u201d\nForeigner, led by singer Lou Gramm and guitarist Mick Jones, recorded nine Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and six Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200, including \u201c4,\u201d which spent 10 weeks in the top spot in 1981. \nForeigner were nominated for three Grammys and their songs have been heard on everything \u201cMiami Vice\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d to \u201cArrested Development\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201d Tone-Loc sampled \u201cHot Blooded\u201d to create \u201cFunky Cold Medina.\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t the best looking band in the world. We weren\u2019t the most dress-conscious band in the world. But Mick and Lou came up with some very, very strong songs and that\u2019s what\u2019s kept it going,\u201d bassist Rick Wills says. \u201cSixteen top 30 hits isn\u2019t too shabby.\u201d\nThe belated embrace by rock's establishment has a bittersweet taste, since original bassist Ed Gagliardi and multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald have died and Jones has been sidelined by Parkinson\u2019s disease. The band will be inducted Oct. 19 in Cleveland.\nThe opening of the door for Foreigner coincided with a change in hall leadership in 2023 that led to key legacy acts getting invites, like Cher and Peter Frampton. Foreigner were among the top vote getters when the fans voted, nabbing almost 528,000 votes or 12.54%.\nThey'll join Mary J. Blige, A Tribe Called Quest, Kool & the Gang, Ozzy Osbourne, Dave Matthews Band, the late Jimmy Buffett, MC5, Dionne Warwick, Alexis Korner, the late John Mayall and Big Mama Thornton in the class of '24.\n\u201cI think a lot of the talent that is in this class has been waiting on the outside as well as Foreigner,\u201d says Greenwood. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful that I\u2019m in this class with such incredible talent.\u201d \nThe band got a public push from Jones\u2019 son-in-law Mark Ronson, who recruited musical friends such as Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl, Slash, Jack Black and the Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 Chad Smith.\nForeigner in their heyday offered varied songs \u2014 the ballad \u201cI Want to Know What Love Is\u201d is very different from \u201cUrgent\u201d \u2014 but many have endured to become the backbone of classic rock playlists. A new line-up \u2014 dubbed Foreigner 2.0 \u2014 attract tens of thousands a night on tour. \nJones started the American-British band in 1976 in New York City, selecting each of its members, the first being Greenwood, who he'd never met. The keyboardist was invited to jam with Jones in a storage area of the band's manager's office. \nBut Greenwood soon grew disillusioned by the lack of progress over two weeks and decided to tell Jones he was going back to his own band.\n\u201cI\u2019m about to go up to Mick and Mick comes in and says, \u2018I\u2019ve got this song.\u2019 And he starts playing \u2018Feels Like the First Time\u2019 on guitar. And I go, \u2018Wow, I think we got something here,\u2019\" he says laughing. \"Thankfully, I did not leave.\u201d \nThe fledgling band's four-song demo \u2014 which included a raw version of \u201cFeels Like the First Time\u201d \u2014 was turned down by all the major record labels until music legend John Kalodner convinced Atlantic Records to reconsider.\nFour hit albums in five years \u2014 \u201cForeigner,\u201d \u201cDouble Vision,\u201d \u201cHead Games\u201d and \u201c4\u201d \u2014 cemented the band's place in classic rock history but not in the Rock Hall. Members watched bands that used to open for Foreigner go in while they waited. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us quite believed it because we thought, well, it was never going to happen,\u201d says Wills, who spent 12 years in Foreigner and then went into Bad Company.\nWills joined in 1979 after having worked with Frampton and Roxy Music. He was in New York and called Gramm because he heard Foreigner was looking for a new bassist. He was invited to their open auditions the next day. \nAfter Wills showed his chops on songs like \u201cDouble Vision\u201d and \u201cHot Blooded,\u201d drummer Dennis Elliott announced he wanted Willis in the band. There were some 70 bassists still waiting to audition.\nWillis urgently left to fly home to London to help care for his two young children, who were suffering from whooping cough and chickenpox, and woke up to a phone call that he was in the band.

This includes his high-profile relationships with actors Demi Lovato and Lindsay Lohan.\nWhen asked why he chose to opt out of mentioning his past relationships, Valderrama responded that his focus when writing this book was on the theme of service.\n\u201cThe book is about my family \u2014 my mother, and my father\u2019s story. I traveled with the USO for so many years; all of those stories, those brothers and sisters of uniform, kind of taught me so much about who protects the freedoms and all of that. And that was that\u2019s what the book is about.\u201d\nThe only romantic relationship mentioned in the book is the one with his current fiancee Amanda Pacheco.\nValderrama and Pacheco both share a daughter and the actor hopes that one day, his young daughter will no longer have to worry about the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood. \n\u201cI certainly hope she can appreciate the fight that most of us had to do to actually open the gate for a lot of these things to be possible,\u201d he said.\nHis vow to his family is one that he has also made to his cultural community: to showcase their achievements for audiences who might not interact with Latinos on a daily basis. \n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/golijovs-flamenco-tinged-opera-slain-spanish-playwright-lorca-114594178", "Title": "Golijov's Flamenco-tinged opera about slain Spanish playwright Lorca comes to the Met", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 9:28 AM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- Osvaldo Golijov was running out of time.The Argentine-born composer had been commissioned by the Tanglewood Music Center for a chamber opera to be performed in the summer of 2003. And with the deadline just months away, his original idea wasn\u2019t panning out.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go anywhere. I had nothing,\u201d he recalled in an interview.\nHappily, a friend introduced him to playwright David Henry Hwang, and they agreed to collaborate on a piece about a historical figure they both admired: Federico Garcia Lorca, the leftist Spanish dramatist and poet who was killed by fascist forces at the start of the Spanish Civil War.\nOf necessity, the collaboration proceeded fast and furiously. \u201cI was so pressed for time that he started faxing me pages, one by one,\u201d Golijov said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how the thing was going to end or anything.\u201d Hwang wrote the libretto in English and Golijov translated it into Spanish.\nSomehow the result, \u201cAinadamar,\u201d premiered on schedule. It was restaged in revised form two years later at the Santa Fe Opera, and is now coming to the Metropolitan Opera in a production by Brazilian director and choreographer Deborah Colker that runs for nine performances beginning Oct. 15.\nThe title is an Arabic word that translates as \u201cfountain of tears\u201d and refers to a spring in the hills above the city of Granada \u2014 the site where Lorca was assassinated in 1936.\nHwang said he and Golijov were \u201cmoved by the fact that Lorca had to some extent predicted his own murder through his work.\u201d His early play, \u201cMariana Pineda\u201d tells of a Spanish heroine of the 19th century liberal movement who was executed for refusing to betray her comrades.\nMargarita Xirgu, who starred in that play, became Lorca\u2019s muse, and when she fled to Cuba she tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to join her.\nEarly on, Hwang decided to have Xirgu, rather than Lorca, be the main character in the opera.\n\u201cI liked the idea of creating Lorca through the memories of Margarita,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cI feel in general that when you\u2019re dealing with an iconic figure, it\u2019s interesting to see them refracted through the perceptions of those who had some sort of intimate relationship with them.\u201d\nAn unexpected wrinkle arose when Golijov realized that Tanglewood had already assembled a cast for the opera he didn\u2019t write \u2014 and it was all women.\n\u201cAnd there was one who had this extraordinary dark voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI got goosebumps. I told David, how about we make Lorca a woman.\u201d\nSo what many critics have seen as a nod to a time-honored operatic tradition of having a woman portray a young man in a \u201ctrousers role\u201d actually came about as a matter of necessity.\nAt the Met, the role of Lorca will be sung by mezzo Daniela Mack. Soprano Angel Blue is Margarita (with Gabriella Reyes substituting on Oct. 30.) Soprano Elena Villal\u00f3n portrays Margarita\u2019s protege Nuria, Flamenco singer Alfredo Tejada is the politician who arranged Lorca\u2019s execution, and the conductor is Miguel Harth-Bedoya. The 90-minute opera is performed without intermission.\nWhen the production premiered in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2022, Rowena Smith in The Guardian described Golijov\u2019s score as \u201ca collage of influences, shifting fluidly from Flamenco and electronic music to the classical language of 19th-century opera.\u201d\n\u201cIn this production the musical language finds a mirror in Deborah Colker\u2019s striking staging,\u201d she added.\nColker, who had never directed an opera, said she approached the staging as a choreographer, with singers and chorus members joining in the continual flow of dance rhythms. She enlisted a Flamenco choreographer, Antonio Najarro, to assist her.\n\u201cI want constant movement,\u201d Colker said. \u201cI want the audience not to recognize who is dancing, who is singing. Everybody is moving the sets, building the barricades, the tabletops where people dance in Spanish bars.\u201d\nGolijov himself said he found Colker\u2019s work revelatory.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen dozens of productions and this is the one that actually made me discover things in the piece that I hadn\u2019t discovered,\u201d he said. \u201cShe got the tectonic movements, the very slow geological movements that are in the structure of the opera, so when she creates a climax, it\u2019s 10 more times explosive because she knows how to build it.\u201d\nYuval Sharon, artistic director of the Detroit Opera, said that when his company staged the production, \u201cit set our audience on fire. They had never seen anything like it before.\u201d\nFor Golijov, having his opera performed at the Met is especially sweet given his troubled history with the company. He had been commissioned to compose a new piece for the 2018\u201319 season. But in 20016, the Met canceled the commission, citing the composer\u2019s lack of progress.\n\u201cI had a few years of bad depression,\u201d Golijov acknowledges. \u201cI wrote much less, and I think they got scared that I would never finish the opera.\u201d\nIn recent years, he has again become productive, composing a song cycle, \u201cFalling Out of Time,\u201d a violin concerto, and other pieces. He also wrote the score for Francis Ford\u2019s Coppola\u2019s new movie, \u201cMegalopolis.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s beginning work on a new opera, inspired by what he calls a lifelong fascination with Laika, the Soviet dog who became the first living creature to orbit the Earth.\nDoes he hope it also might eventually see a production at the Met?\nGolijov said that after the earlier disappointment, \u201cI think they love me, but they don\u2019t trust me.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/oprah-winfrey-selects-lisa-marie-presleys-posthumous-memoir-114590979", "Title": "Oprah Winfrey selects Lisa Marie Presley's posthumous memoir as her next book club selection", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 8:19 AM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- Oprah Winfrey has chosen Lisa Marie Presley's posthumous memoir as her new book club pick, and made a trip to the famed Graceland estate in Memphis, Tennessee, to meet with Presley's daughter and Elvis and Priscilla Presley's granddaughter, actor Riley Keough.Lisa Marie Presley's \u201cFrom Here to the Great Unknown,\" completed by Keough after Presley died unexpectedly in 2023, was published Tuesday.

Lawyers for WWE and Laurinaitis did not immediately return emails seeking comment late Monday. Emails to the WWE and its parent companies, Endeavor Group Holdings and its subsidiary, TKO Group Holdings, also were not returned immediately.\nMcMahon, former CEO and chairman of WWE, has denied Grant\u2019s allegations. \nGrant, who worked in WWE\u2019s legal and talent departments from 2019 to 2022, sued the company, McMahon and Laurinaitis in January, making graphic allegations of sexual assault, harassment, trafficking and other physical and emotional abuse.\nMcMahon stepped down as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in Grant\u2019s lawsuit. He also resigned as executive chairman of the board of directors TKO Group Holdings in January, a day after Grant filed her lawsuit.\n\u201cIf WWE and its parent company Endeavor are serious about parting ways with Vince McMahon and the toxic workplace culture he created, their executives should have no problem with releasing former WWE employees from their NDAs,\u201d Ann Callis, Grant\u2019s attorney, said in a statement. \u201cThis is the first step to rehabilitating a company that covered up decades of sexual assault and human trafficking.\"\nMcMahon previously responded to Grant\u2019s lawsuit with a statement calling it \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.\nLaurinaitis\u2019 lawyer has denied the allegations, and said Laurinaitis was also a victim in the case.\nGrant says she was pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.\nFour other women \u2014 all formerly affiliated with WWE \u2014 signed agreements with McMahon that bar them from discussing their relationships with him, the Wall Street Journal reported in July 2022, citing people familiar with the deals and documents it reviewed. Grant was not among those women, her representatives say.\nIn December 2022, McMahon agreed to pay a female former wrestling referee millions of dollars to settle her allegations that he raped her in 1986, the Journal also reported. McMahon said the alleged sexual assault never happened, and his lawyer said he settled the suit to avoid costly litigation.\nGrant's request for the Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE to waive enforcement of the NDAs is similar to ones made to other companies when sexual misconduct allegations arose.\nIn 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Weinstein Co. and NBC Universal released employees, former employees and others from NDAs made in connection with sexual misconduct claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer.\nVictims' lawyers call NDAs instruments to silence accusers while allowing alleged abusers to avoid accountability. A federal law approved in 2022 and similar laws in more than a dozen states curb the use of NDAs that block victims of sexual harassment from speaking publicly about their allegations.\nThe Associated Press does not normally name people who make sexual assault allegations unless they come forward publicly, which Grant did.\nShe alleges McMahon forced her into a sexual relationship with him in order for her to get and keep a job, and later directed her to have sexual relations with others including Laurinaitis. She also accuses McMahon and Laurinaitis of sexually assaulting her at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\nThe lawsuit further claims McMahon recruited other people for sexual relations with Grant, shared pornographic photos and videos of her with other men including WWE employees despite saying he wouldn\u2019t and subjected her to cruel and humiliating acts.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/netflix-series-explores-womens-dreams-body-slamming-world-114586546", "Title": "Netflix series explores women's dreams in the body-slamming world of Japanese pro wrestling", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 1:38 AM", "Content": "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 \u201cThe Queen of Villains\u201d is a typical coming-of-age tale about a young woman\u2019s road to empowerment and self-discovery \u2014 except it all takes place in the body-slamming, arm-twisting world of Japanese professional wrestling.The Netflix series, which began airing last month, tells the story of Dump Matsumoto, a real-life wrestling legend from the 1980s who grew up poor with a father who was often absent or abusive.\nMatsumoto grew up angry, she said, and went on to create in her wrestling persona a ferocious, almost camp villain character, known in the sport as a \u201cheel,\u201d complete with outlandish Kabuki-like facial makeup, chains, sticks and a grotesque scowl. She loomed large as a symbol of fearless and defiant womanhood.\n\u201cI gave it my all to be evil,\u201d Matsumoto said.\nA hefty woman with a friendly smile, Matsumoto makes a point even now to adamantly deny that she was ever a nice person or acknowledge that many people in Japan, especially women, love her.\n\u201cI still beat people up in matches. I stuck forks in them and made them bleed,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cAll the people who pretend to be good are the truly evil ones.\u201d\n\u201cThe Queen of Villains\u201d follows the friendship between Matsumoto and Chigusa Nagayo of the popular wrestling tag team known as the Crush Gals. Nagayo served as an adviser, trainer and choreographer for the series\u2019 dramatized wrestling scenes.\nJapanese professional wrestling fans still talk about the matches between Matsumoto and the Crush Gals, including the ones they fought in the U.S.\nThe actresses in the series spent two years training for their roles. They gained weight and muscle, and learned techniques like the \u201cgiant swing,\u201d in which a wrestler grabs her opponent\u2019s legs and moves in a dizzying circle, or the \u201cflying knee kick,\u201d which involves a jump and kick to the body while airborne. \nThe trick in professional wrestling is to execute the punches and body slams convincingly but in a controlled way to avoid serious injuries. A wrestler also must know how to fall properly. \nOne key fight scene took a month to film as the actors went over each move, again and again. \n\u201cDump played a role to be hated by the entire nation,\u201d said Yuriyan Retriever, a professional comedian who stars as Matsumoto in the series.\n\u201cPreviously, there was a limit, maybe even unintentionally, beyond which I couldn\u2019t go. But when I played Dump, all those emotions had to come out and be expressed,\u201d she said.\nShe felt like she was no longer playing a role, she said, but that she had become Dump Matsumoto. \n\u201cIt\u2019s frightening to be hated, and I don\u2019t think anyone wants to be hated,\u201d Retriever said. \n\u201cWhen I finished a cut, I was crying. And my body was shaking. I can\u2019t express it in words, but I understood all the pressures Dump must have felt.\u201d\nThe series not only presents a women-beating-the-odds story against a backdrop of sexism and abusive management but it also captures the postwar period of the Showa-era in a way that feels authentic. The scenes used thousands of extras, many of them serious wrestling fans.\nSome viewers say the real-life wrestling was more intense than the dramatized version in the new series.\nRionne McAvoy, an Australian filmmaker who as a professional wrestler was hit with a stick by Matsumoto, said: \u201cThe actors often fail to capture the intensity, grit and charisma required for these roles.\"\nBut for most viewers, it\u2019s real enough and heartbreaking.\n\u201cThis is an eternal but emotional story portraying ordinary girls who passionately pursued a dream, found friendship and also themselves,\u201d director Kazuya Shiraishi said.\n\u201cIt gave me a chance to reflect on my own 15-year filmmaking career, what I truly want to be, what kind of films I want to make. I just wanted to tell their story, which is also everyone\u2019s story.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/harris-introducing-sets-media-tour-people-voting-114585950", "Title": "Harris gets personal in media blitz, balks at breaking with Biden on policy", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:10 AM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- Kamala Harris wanted to help voters get to know her better with a cascade of media appearances on Tuesday, but the most lasting impression might have been her unwillingness to break with Joe Biden.Asked on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d how she would be different from the president she\u2019s served under for four years, Harris said \u201cwe\u2019re obviously two different people\u201d and \u201cI will bring those sensibilities to how I lead.\u201d\nHowever, she was not able to identify a decision where she would have gone another way. \u201cThere is not a thing that comes to mind,\u201d Harris said.\nThe exchange encapsulated Harris\u2019 struggle to portray herself as a candidate who can deliver the change voters crave while also remaining loyal to the current administration. Some Harris aides privately winced as gleeful Republicans swiftly circulated clips of her response and Donald Trump swiped at her in a social media post, calling it \u201cher dumbest answer so far.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until later in the show that Harris named something that she would do differently than Biden \u2014 she would put a Republican in her Cabinet.\nThe Democratic nominee said she would welcome contributions from the other party \u201cbecause I don\u2019t feel burdened by letting pride get in the way of a good idea.\u201d\nThe interview was a reminder that friendly media venues \u2014 the women of \u201cThe View\u201d were nearly rapturous in their embrace of Harris \u2014 can be as treacherous for politicians to navigate as hardball journalistic interrogations. And it came at a delicate moment for Harris, whose motorcade whisked her from studio to studio in New York on Tuesday.\nEven though her abbreviated and unexpected campaign for the presidency is more than half over, Harris is still racing to introduce herself to voters who haven\u2019t made up their minds about her or whether to cast ballots in this year\u2019s election. After \u201cThe View,\u201d she spoke to radio host Howard Stern and planned to tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances came after Harris granted interviews to CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d which aired Monday night, and Alex Cooper\u2019s podcast \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d which was released Sunday. \nIt's a kaleidoscopic media blitz intended to reach key demographics, from men who are longtime fans of Stern to young women who follow Cooper's frank conversations about sex and relationships. \nHarris' decision to open up is a sharp shift after largely avoiding interviews since replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, and it\u2019s an acknowledgment that she needs to do more to defeat Trump.\nGetting personal has never been easy for Harris, a lawyer by training whose first job in public life was making opening and closing arguments as a courtroom prosecutor.\n\u201cIt feels immodest to me to talk about myself,\u201d Harris said to Stern. \u201cA friend of mine actually said, \u2018look, this is not a time to worry about modesty, because obviously you gotta let people know who you are.\u2019\u201d\nBy the time she was finished with the interview, Harris had, by her standards, bared her soul. Some examples:\nShe ate a family sized bag of Doritos after Trump beat Hillary Clinton. She works out on an elliptical every day. Her first job was cleaning test tubes at her mother\u2019s laboratory, and she got fired. Her favorite Formula One driver is Lewis Hamilton. She went to see U2 at the Sphere in Las Vegas, and she recommends going with a \u201cclear head,\u201d meaning not high on drugs, because \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of visual stimulation.\u201d\nHarris also said \u201cI literally lose sleep\u201d over the election because \u201cthe stakes are so high.\u201d\nAnna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said Harris has to energize people who have tuned out politics because they believe \u201call the politicians are the same, they all say the same thing, they don\u2019t know anything about my life, I can\u2019t relate to them at all.\"\n\u201cThey want to like and trust you,\" she said. \nJennifer Harris, the former White House senior director of international economics, said Harris has a steeper hill to climb because of the way she became the Democratic nominee.\n\u201cWe did not have a good long primary to meet Kamala Harris in the way most voters are accustomed to,\u201d she said. Harris has to find a way to demonstrate the instincts and principles that \u201dwill be guiding any number of hundreds of specific policy questions that will come up in the course of the presidency.\u201d\nHarris used her Tuesday appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d to discuss her proposal to have Medicare cover in-home care for the elderly, helping to relieve the burden faced by an increasing number of families.\n\u201cThere are so many people in our country who are right in the middle,\" she said. \"They\u2019re taking care of their kids and taking care of their aging parents.\u201d\nShe spoke about taking care of her own mother when she was dying of cancer, including cooking for her and picking out soft clothing that wouldn't irritate her. And she criticized Trump as selfish and uninterested in helping Americans. If you watch his grievance-filled rallies, she said, \u201che does not talk about what your parents need, what your children need.\u201d\nInstead, Harris said, \u201che talks about his needs.\u201d\nIt was a moment that Harris' campaign would much rather get noticed than her answer about Biden. They believe that a small yet pivotal numbers of undecided voters want to know more about Harris before making up their minds, and that the more those voters see Harris, the more they like her.\nRepublican communications strategist Kevin Madden said defining Harris in voters' eyes is the central challenge of the campaign.\n\u201cThis race is actually pretty simple in the sense that the next few weeks are about who\u2019s going to fill in the blanks on who Harris is,\u201d he said. \nHarris' name recognition grew when she became vice president, but 1 out of 10 people still said they didn't know enough about her to have an opinion, according to AP-NORC polling. Recent shifts in her favorability numbers suggest that views on Harris may still be somewhat malleable. \nOther polls have similar results. One-quarter of likely voters said they still feel like they need to learn more about Harris, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after her debate against Trump, while about three-quarters say they pretty much already know what they need to know about her. \nNear the end of Harris' interview on the \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast, Cooper confronted the vice president with one of the central questions of this campaign.\nSo many people, Cooper said, are \u201cfrustrated and just exhausted with politics in general,\" so \"why should we trust you?\u201d\nHarris answered by saying \u201cyou can look at my career to know what I care about.\u201d\n\u201cI care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due,\" she said. \"I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/taylor-swift-back-watch-travis-kelce-chiefs-eras-114582465", "Title": "Taylor Swift is back to watch Travis Kelce and the Chiefs with Eras Tour soon to resume", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 7:47 PM", "Content": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Taylor Swift was back at Arrowhead Stadium on Monday night to see her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the Kansas City Chiefs play the New Orleans Saints after the pop superstar had missed the team's previous two games on the road.Swift is in the final days of a break from her record-setting Eras Tour, which resumes with the first of three shows Friday night at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami.

That includes the now-dismissed federal case accusing him of sexually exploiting minors and possessing child sexual abuse material, charges that stemmed from the same allegations that led to his arrest.\nChasing Horse still faces criminal charges in Canada, on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, and in Las Vegas.\nBest known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.\nIn the decades since starring in the Oscar-winning movie, authorities say he built a reputation as a self-proclaimed medicine man among tribes and traveled around North America to perform healing ceremonies.\nHe\u2019s accused of using that position to gain access to vulnerable girls and women starting in the early 2000s, leading a cult and taking underage wives.\nFederal prosecutors took no action in their case against Chasing Horse after filing the charges in February 2023, court records show. They moved to dismiss the case on Sept. 27 \u2014 a day after the Nevada high court ordered the dismissal of Chasing Horse's indictment in state court \u2014 but did not detail in court filings why they wanted to dismiss the case.\nBoth the state and federal cases were dismissed without prejudice, meaning prosecutors can refile the charges. Federal prosecutor Steven Rose didn't immediately respond to an email Monday asking if the U.S. government intends to do so. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said his office will refile the charges in state court, which included sexual assault of a minor, kidnapping and child abuse.\nState prosecutors on Friday filed a new case in Las Vegas against Chasing Horse that accuses him of filming himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. He is being held in the custody of Las Vegas police on $200,000 bail.\nIn at least one video, the girl was \u201cfully passed out,\" prosecutor William Rowles said Monday in court.\nRowles said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, were found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.\nHis defense attorney, Kristy Holston, declined to comment on the new case or the dismissal of the federal charges. Rowles also said he had no comment.\nThe Nevada Supreme Court in late September sided with Chasing Horse, after his attorney successfully argued that a definition of grooming \u2014 presented to the grand jury without expert testimony \u2014 had tainted the state's case, and that prosecutors should have shared with the grand jury inconsistent statements made by one of the victims.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/movie-armorer-alec-baldwins-film-rust-pleads-guilty-114579613", "Title": "Movie armorer on Alec Baldwin's film 'Rust' pleads guilty to gun charge in separate case", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 6:02 PM", "Content": "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The weapons supervisor in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer by Alec Baldwin on the set of the Western film \u201cRust\" pleaded guilty Monday to a separate criminal charge of carrying a gun into a licensed liquor establishment.Movie armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed agreed to change her plea to guilty on the charge in exchange for a reduced sentence of 18 months supervised probation. \nJudge T. Glenn Ellington approved the agreement that allows Gutierrez-Reed to begin probation while serving out an 18-month prison term at a New Mexico state penitentiary for involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.\nIn the \u201cRust\u201d case, prosecutors blamed Gutierrez-Reed for unwittingly bringing live ammunition onto the movie set and for failing to follow basic gun safety protocols.\nGutierrez-Reed shuffled into the Santa Fe courtroom Monday in a beige jumpsuit, handcuffs and ankle shackles to change her plea to guilty and waive her right to trial.\n\u201cI'd just like to apologize to the court and thank you for your judgment today,\u201d she said.\nThe case stems from evidence that a few weeks before \u201cRust\u201d began filming in October 2021, Gutierrez-Reed carried a gun into a downtown bar in Santa Fe where firearms are prohibited. \nSpecial prosecutor Kari Morrissey said Gutierrez-Reed filmed herself in the bathroom of the bar with a handgun \u2014 explaining how she snuck in the prohibited firearm in a video that was obtained when authorities searched the armorer's phone during the \u201cRust\u201d investigation.\nGutierrez-Reed was convicted in March at trial of involuntary manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Hutchins. She has an appeal of that conviction pending in a higher court.\nBaldwin, the lead actor and co-producer for \u201cRust,\u201d was pointing a gun at Hutchins during a rehearsal for the film when the revolver went off, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza.\nIn July, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed an involuntary manslaughter case against Baldwin halfway through a trial based on the withholding of evidence by police and prosecutors from the defense. Morrissey has since asked the judge to reconsider.\nUnder terms of her plea agreement, Gutierrez-Reed is prohibited while on probation from possessing firearms, consuming alcohol or drugs and must pay $180 in fees while submitting a sample of her DNA to a criminal database and completing an addiction treatment program.\nDefense attorney Jason Bowles said the agreement makes it possible for Gutierrez-Reed to be released from prison as soon as June 2025 to complete probation in Arizona without getting an additional felony conviction on her record.\nBefore being led away, Gutierrez-Reed blew kisses toward the court gallery where her mother, Stacy Reed, was seated.\nReed said she was grateful her daughter can begin to fulfill new parole requirements prior to release from prison.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/lore-segal-esteemed-austrian-american-writer-fled-nazis-114579039", "Title": "Lore Segal, esteemed Austrian American writer who fled the Nazis as a child, dies at 96", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 5:56 PM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lore Segal, an esteemed Viennese American author and translator whose gift for words helped her family escape from the Nazis and who later drew upon her experiences as a Jewish refugee and immigrant for such fiction as \u201cOther People's Houses\u201d and \u201cHer First American,\u201d died Monday at 96.Segal, a longtime resident of Manhattan's Upper West Side, died in her apartment after a brief illness, her publisher Melville House said in a statement.\nAfter settling in the U.S. in 1951, Segal wrote novels, short stories, essays and children's books and translated the Bible and Grimms' fairy tales, which featured illustrations by her friend Maurice Sendak. Her life \u2014 filtered through memory and imagination \u2014 was her greatest muse. \u201cOther People's Houses,\u201d released in 1964 and originally serialized in the New Yorker, closely followed her childhood in Austria, her years in foster care in London during World War II and her arrival in New York, where the growing familiarity with the city\u2019s sights and sounds \u2014 \u201ccharged thus upon the air\u201d \u2014 makes the \u201calien into a citizen.\u201d\n\u201cHer First American\u201d continued her early experiences in the U.S., while \u201cLucinella\u201d was a comic novella inspired by her time in the 1970s at the Yaddo artist retreat in upstate New York. Segal, who taught at Columbia University, Princeton University and several other schools, satirized academic life in \u201cShakespeare's Kitchen.\u201d\nIn 2019, she compiled her fiction and nonfiction in the anthology \u201cThe Journal I Did Not Keep,\u201d in which she summarized the importance and imperfection of recapturing the past.\n\u201cI believe that the act of remembering and telling the story of what we remember will always be to some extent fatal to the thing remembered,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo what really happened?\u201d\nHer many admirers included such author-critics as Cynthia Ozick, Vivian Gornick and Alfred Kazin. In 2008, she was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for her novel \u201cShakespeare\u2019s Kitchen.\u201d The American Academy of Arts and Letters inducted her in 2023.\nGornick would cite her \u201cironic intelligence\" and \u201cgift for detachment.\u201d In her fiction, Segal set a tone that was even, objective and occasionally cutting, like her description of an artist in \u201cLucinella\u201d who \u201ctends to mumble her words inside her mouth, so as to keep the option of eating them.\u201d She could also be intimate and familiar, with such recurring characters as her alter ego Ilka, a Viennese refugee; and Carter Bayoux, a Black intellectual with whom Ilka has an affair in \u201cHer First American.\u201d\nHer narratives were often sustained through passages of overheard conversation, whether at a literary cocktail party in Harlem or a gathering of faculty members in Connecticut. Several stories in her 2023 collection \u201cLadies' Lunch\u201d were structured around the midday meals of friends in advanced old age who share memories, regrets, fears and everyday concerns.\n\u201cI like writing dialogue,\u201d she told the online publication The Millions in 2019. \u201cI like it better than explaining. I\u2019d rather have a character develop and express him or herself through dialogue than explaining what they\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s a preference. I like how we discover and uncover ourselves through dialogue. I tell my students, you see any two people together, walk behind them, listen, get the tone of their voice.\u201d\nBesides her books, Segal wrote for The New York Times, The New Republic, the Forward and other publications. The children's story \u201cWhen Mole Lost His Glasses,\u201d with drawings by Sergio Ruzzier, was adapted into an educational video featuring Spike Lee and then-New York Knick Stephon Marbury.\nSegal married the literary editor David Segal in 1961 and had two children. Her husband died of a heart attack in 1970.\nShe was born Lore Groszmann in Vienna in 1928, and grew up in a prosperous neighborhood until the Nazis annexed the country a decade later and antisemitism drove her family to ship her off on the Kindertransport to London, a time Segal and her mother would discuss in Mark Jonathan Harris\u2019 Academy Award-winning documentary \u201cInto the Arms of Strangers.\u201d\nSeparation somehow empowered her. Inquisitive and often impulsive, she wrote so many letters to British authorities that they granted her parents the rare privilege of letting them join her in London, where they worked as domestic servants. Lore stayed with a series of families, including one whose incomprehension of her past inspired her first real storytelling.\n\u201cIt seemed to me they had no idea of what it was like to live in Vienna under Hitler,\u201d Segal told The Associated Press in 2011. \u201cThey were asking me questions that didn\u2019t seem to be relevant. They had some profound lack of information. So I got hold of one of those little exercise books, homework books. I filled the 36 pages in German with the story, which is essentially the story of \u2018Other People\u2019s Houses.\u2019\u201d\nAfter the war, Segal graduated from the University of London\u2019s Bedford College and lived briefly in the Dominican Republic \u2014 where other family members had settled \u2014 until allowed in the United States. Before becoming a writer, she discovered the various careers she was not meant for: She was a \u201cbad file clerk,\u201d a \u201cbad secretary\u201d and \u201cpretty bad textile designer.\"\nWriting, at first, also didn't seem to work because she believed she had nothing to say.

The injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Donato will require Google to make several changes that the Mountain View, California, company had been resisting. Those include a provision that will require its Play Store for Android apps to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.\nThe judge\u2019s order will also make the millions of Android apps in the Play Store library accessible to rivals, allowing them to offer up a competitive selection.\nDonato is giving Google until November to make the revisions dictated in his order. The company had insisted it would take 12 to 16 months to design the safeguards needed to reduce the chances of potentially malicious software making its way into rival Android app stores and infecting millions of Samsung phones and other mobile devices running on its free Android software.\nThe court-mandated overhaul is meant to prevent Google from walling off competition in the Android app market as part of an effort to protect a commission system that has been a boon for one of the world's most prosperous companies and helped elevate the market value of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc. to $2 trillion.\nGoogle said in a blog post that it will ask the court to pause the pending changes, and will appeal the court\u2019s decision.\nDonato also ruled that, for a period of three years ending Nov. 1, 2027, Google won't be able to share revenue from its Play Store with anyone who distributes Android apps or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store. It also won't be allowed to pay developers, or share revenue, so that they will launch an app in the Google Play Store first or exclusively, and can't make deals with manufacturers to preinstall the Google Play store on any specific location on an Android device. It also won't be able to require apps to use its billing system or tell customers that they can download apps elsewhere and potentially for cheaper. \nThe Play Store has been earning billions of dollars annually for years, primarily through 15% to 30% commissions that Google has been imposing on digital transactions completed within Android apps. It's a similar fee structure to the one that Apple deploys in its iPhone app store \u2014 a structure that prompted video game maker Epic Games to file antitrust lawsuits four years ago in an effort to foster competition that could help drive down prices for both app makers and consumers.\nA federal judge mostly sided with Apple in a September 2021 decision that was upheld by an appeals court. Still, a jury favored Epic Games after the completion of a four-week trial completed last year and delivered a verdict that tarred the Play Store as an illegal monopoly.\nThat prompted another round of hearings this year to help Donato determine what steps should be taken to restore fair competition. Google argued that Epic Games was seeking some extreme changes, saddling the company with costs that could run as high as $600 billion. Epic contended Google could level the playing field for as little as $1 million. It's unclear how much the changes ordered by Donato will cost Google. \nAlthough Epic lost its antitrust case against Apple, Donato's ruling could still have ripple effects on the iPhone app store as another federal judge weighs whether Apple is making it easy enough to promote different ways that consumers can pay for digital transactions. Apple was ordered to allow in-app links to alternative payment systems as part of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' decision in that case, but Epic contends the provision is being undermined with the creation of another commission system that stifles consumer choice.\nThe forthcoming Play Store shakeup could be just the first unwelcome shock that antitrust law delivers to Google. In the biggest antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department in a quarter century, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in August declared Google's dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly, too, and is now getting ready to start hearings on how to punish Google for that bad behavior. Google is appealing Mehta's ruling in the search engine case in hopes of warding off a penalty that could hurt its business even more than the changes being ordered in the Play Store. \n\u201cProvided the ruling survives the appeals process, Google will almost certainly take a revenue hit,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \u201cNo doubt some of the largest app developers like Epic Games will start encroaching on Google Play Store\u2019s market share, meaning Google will lose out on its usual cut of subscription and in-app purchases.\u201d\nThe analyst added that, while the Google Play Store will likely continue to benefit from brand recognition since it was the default Android app store for so long, \u201csome consumers may defect if they can get better deals on their favorite apps elsewhere.\u201d And app developers will likely take advantage of the opportunity to let consumers know about direct downloads. \n\u201cSo Google may see fewer Play Store revenues even among the Android users that stick to the default,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/cissy-houston-whitney-houstons-mother-grammy-winning-singer-114570980", "Title": "Cissy Houston, Whitney Houston's mother and Grammy-winning singer, dies at 91", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:56 PM", "Content": "LOS ANGELES -- Cissy Houston, a two-time Grammy-winning soul and gospel artist who sang with Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley and other stars and knew triumph and heartbreak as the mother of Whitney Houston, has died.

The acclaimed gospel singer was surrounded by her family.\n\u201cOur hearts are filled with pain and sadness. We loss the matriarch of our family,\u201d Pat Houston said in a statement. She said her mother-in-law's contributions to popular music and culture are \"unparalleled.\" \n\u201cMother Cissy has been a strong and towering figure in our lives. A woman of deep faith and conviction, who cared greatly about family, ministry, and community. Her more than seven-decade career in music and entertainment will remain at the forefront of our hearts.\u201d\nA church performer from an early age, Houston was part of a family gospel act before breaking through in popular music in the 1960s as a member of the prominent backing group The Sweet Inspirations with Doris Troy and her niece Dee Dee Warwick. The group sang backup for a variety of soul singers including Otis Redding, Lou Rawls and The Drifters. They also sang backup for Dionne Warwick.\nHouston's many credits included Franklin\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201d(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\u201d Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d and Dusty Springfield\u2019s \u201cSon of a Preacher Man.\u201d The Sweet Inspirations also sang on stage with Presley, whom Houston would remember fondly for singing gospel during rehearsal breaks and telling her that she was \u201csquirrelly.\u201d\n\u201cAt the end of our engagement with him, he gave me a bracelet inscribed with my name on the outside,\u201d she wrote in her memoir \u201cHow Sweet the Sound,\u201d published in 1998. \u201cOn the inside of the bracelet he had inscribed his nickname for me: Squirrelly.\u201d\nThe Sweet Inspirations had their own top 20 single with the soul-rock \u201cSweet Inspiration,\u201d made in the Memphis studio where Franklin and Springfield among others recorded hits and released four albums just in the late \u201960s. The group appeared on Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d and sang background vocals for The Jimi Hendrix Experience on the song \u201cBurning of the Midnight Lamp\u201d in 1967.\nHouston\u2019s last performance with The Sweet Inspirations came after the group hit the stage with Presley in a Las Vegas show in 1969. Her final recording session with the group turned into their biggest R&B hit \u201c(Gotta Find) A Brand New Lover\u201d a composition by the production team of Gamble & Huff, who appeared on the group\u2019s fifth album, \u201cSweet Sweet Soul.\u201d\nDuring that time, the group occasionally performed live concert dates with Franklin. After the group\u2019s success and four albums together, Houston left The Sweet Inspirations to pursue a solo career where she flourished.\nHouston became an in-demand session singer and recorded more than 600 songs in multiple genres throughout her career. Her vocals can be heard on tracks alongside a wide range of artists including Chaka Khan, Donny Hathaway, Jimi Hendrix, Luther Vandross, Beyonc\u00e9, Paul Simon, Roberta Flack and Whitney Houston.\nCissy Houston went on to complete several records, including \u201cPresenting Cissy Houston,\u201d the disco-era \u201cThink It Over\u201d and the Grammy-winning gospel albums \u201cFace to Face\u201d and \u201cHe Leadeth Me.\u201d \nIn 1971, Houston\u2019s signature vocals were featured on Burt Bacharach\u2019s solo album, which includes \u201cMexican Divorce,\u201d \u201cAll Kinds of People\u201d and \u201cOne Less Bell to Answer.\u201d She performed various standards including Barbra Streisand\u2019s hit song, \u201cEvergreen.\u201d\nNever far from her native New Jersey or musical origins, Houston presided for decades over the 200-member Youth Inspirational Choir at Newark\u2019s New Hope Baptist Church, where Whitney Houston sang as a child. \nCissy Houston would say that she had discouraged her daughter from show business, but they were joined in music for much of Whitney\u2019s life, from church to stage performances to television and film and the recording studio. Whitney\u2019s rise seemed inevitable, not only because of her obvious talents, but because of her background: Dionne and Dee Dee Warwick were cousins, Leontyne Price a cousin once removed, Franklin a close family friend.\nWhitney Houston made her debut on national television when she and Cissy Houston sang a medley of Franklin hits on \u201cThe Merv Griffin Show.\u201d Cissy Houston sang backup on Whitney\u2019s eponymous, multi-platinum first album, and the two shared the lead on \u201cI Know Him So Well,\u201d from the 1987 mega-seller \u201cWhitney.\u201d\nThey would sing together often in concert and appeared in the 1996 film \u201cThe Preacher\u2019s Wife.\u201d Their most indelible moments likely came from the video for one of Whitney\u2019s biggest hits from the mid-1980s, \u201cGreatest Love of All.\" It was filmed as a mother-daughter homage, ending with a joyous Whitney exiting the stage of Harlem\u2019s Apollo Theater and embracing Cissy Houston, who stood in the wings.\nOn Feb. 11, 2012, Whitney Houston was found dead \u2014 from what was ruled as an accidental drowning \u2014 in a Beverly Hills bathtub. Cissy Houston would write about her daughter in the memoir \u201cRemembering Whitney: A Mother\u2019s Story of Life, Loss and The Night The Music Stopped.\u201d \nIn 2015, Cissy Houston was grieving again when granddaughter Bobbi Kristina Brown, the only child of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, was found unconscious in a bathtub, spent months in a coma and died at age 22. The family was back in the news in 2018 with the release of the documentary \u201cWhitney.\u201d which included allegations that Dee Dee Warwick (who died in 2008) had molested Whitney when she was a girl.\nCissy Houston was briefly married to Freddie Garland in the 1950s; their son, Gary Garland, was a guard for the Denver Nuggets and later sang on many of Whitney Houston\u2019s tours. Cissy Houston was married to Whitney\u2019s father, entertainment executive John Russell Houston, from 1959-1990. In addition to Whitney, the Houstons also had a son, Michael.\nCissy Houston was born Emily Drinkard in Newark, the youngest of eight children of a factory worker and a housewife. She was just 5 when she and three siblings founded the Drinkard Singers, a gospel group that lasted 30 years, performing on the same bill as Mahalia Jackson among others and releasing the 1959 album \u201cA Joyful Noise.\u201d\nShe later said she would have been happy to remain in gospel, but John Houston encouraged her to take on studio work. When rockabilly star Ronnie Hawkins (along with drummer Levon Helm and other future members of The Band) needed an extra voice, Cissy Houston stepped in.\n\u201cI wanted to get my work done, and get it done quickly. I was there, but I didn\u2019t have to be part of them. I was in the world, but I wasn\u2019t of the world, as St. Paul put it,\u201d Houston wrote in \u201cHow Sweet the Sound,\u201d remembering how she soon began working with the Drifters and other singers.\n\u201cAt least in the recording studio we were living together as God intended us to. Some days, we spent 12 or 15 hours together there,\" she wrote. \"The skin-deep barriers of race seemed to fall away as we toiled side by side creating our little pop masterpieces.\u201d\nPat Houston said she is thankful for the many valuable lessons learned from her mother-in-law. She said the family feels \u201cblessed and grateful\" that God allowed Cissy to spend so many years. \n\u201cWe are touched by your generous support, and your outpouring of love during our profound time of grief,\u201d Houston said on behalf of the family. \u201cWe respectfully request our privacy during this difficult time.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/cissy-houston-grammy-winner-mother-whitney-houston-dies-114570705", "Title": "Cissy Houston, Grammy winner and mother of Whitney Houston, dies at 91", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:49 PM", "Content": "Video\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/billie-jean-king-named-grand-marshal-136th-rose-114570367", "Title": "Billie Jean King named grand marshal for the 136th Rose Parade on Jan. 1", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:26 PM", "Content": "PASADENA, Calif. -- Tennis great Billie Jean King will preside over the 136th Rose Parade as grand marshal next year.King, who turns 81 next month, was introduced Monday in a shower of confetti on the lawn of Tournament House as \u201cPhiladelphia Freedom,\u201d the hit song Elton John wrote for her, blared.\n\u201cI'm still kicking,\u201d she said, smiling.\nKing will ride the 5 1/2-mile route through the streets of Pasadena on Jan. 1 and be part of the coin flip for the 111th Rose Bowl football game later that day.\n\u201cWe looked forward to it every year,\u201d she said, recalling her childhood in Long Beach. \u201cMy mother and I always loved parades.\"\nThe parade\u2019s theme of \u201cBest Day Ever!\u201d celebrates life\u2019s best moments.\n\u201cI love it,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a whole new saying the rest of my life now.

So when Garfield recently went on a six-day retreat in the woods without his phone, one of his first texts was to his co-star.\u201cI came out and I sent Florence a message. I just felt compelled,\u201d Garfield says. \u201cWhen you reconnect with yourself, you reconnect with a bunch of stuff that matters to you. And I was just like, man, I haven\u2019t let Florence know for a few months how much this film and this time with her meant to me.\u201d\n\u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d directed by John Crowley ( \u201cBrooklyn,\u201d \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d) and penned by playwright Nick Payne, is the kind of movie that provokes an emotional response, including for its two stars. In playing their characters, Almut and Tobias, across a decade of time, \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d poignantly condenses, and remixes into a non-linear narrative, a wide spectrum of life. Right alongside each other are sex and heartbreak, stolen moments and life-changing ones, birth and death.\nIt was enough to go through together as actors that Pugh and Garfield, when they spoke the morning of the film\u2019s premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, were still mourning it.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had this happen before in this way. We\u2019ve literally spent the last two days trying to unpack it and everybody wants us to unpack it. And we don\u2019t know,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cWhen we finished the movie, every scene that got closer and closer to the end, it became harder and harder to process that we weren\u2019t going to be able to do it anymore.\u201d\nAs two of the most in-demand actors of their generation, Pugh, 28, and Garfield, 41, have transformed themselves into all kinds of roles. They have donned Marvel costumes and joined period ensembles. Pugh was memorably outfitted in an elaborate flower dress for \u201cMidsommar.\u201d But \u201cWe Live in Time,\u201d which A24 opens in theaters Friday, is a particularly unadorned view of two of the best actors working. It\u2019s the first film in which Garfield has used his real voice.\n\u201cThey\u2019re two very beautiful creatures to look at, and have looked fantastically beautiful on screen \u2014 and do look very beautiful in this, by the way, just not in a glammed-up, aspirational fashion,\u201d says Crowley. \u201cThey\u2019re also both British actors who have made significant inroads in American cinema, and to some eyes, people might only know them from that. To have them speak in their own accents allowed those roles to fall back much closer to them.\u201d\nChemistry can be a tricky thing to pin down. Crowley, whose 2007 film \u201cBoy A\u201d was Garfield\u2019s feature film debut, cast Garfield first. After that came Pugh. Crowley prefers to keep dress rehearsals subdued in order to save the energy for shooting. But there were, he says, \u201cflickers of something very special\" between them.\n\u201cMuch like two championship tennis players warming up, they couldn\u2019t not once in a while hit the ball in an extraordinary way and have the other person hit it back,\" says Crowley.\nIn an interview together, the connection between Garfield and Pugh was abundantly clear. Their reaction to the meme that sprung from the movie's first image (in which a carousel horse appeared to be their uninvited co-star), was, itself, a viral video that hinted at their natural comic patter. But whatever chemistry is, Garfield is more inclined to attribute it to staying present as actors.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t predict it. I knew Florence was a magnificent actor. But that\u2019s all I knew. I didn\u2019t know whether we\u2019d work together well. Neither of us did,\u201d Garfield says. \u201cBut for me, honestly, it exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s an incomparable thing. There\u2019s no way of comparing my experience with Florence with any other experience I\u2019ve had.\n\u201cI said this to Florence last night, I was like, \u2018It\u2019s weirdly, in a way, one performance. It\u2019s like we\u2019re stitched together.\u2019\u201d\nFor Pugh, chemistry is about showing up with the right intentions.\n\u201cWe were willing and wanting to do that for each other,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of times when you\u2019re willing to do it and someone isn\u2019t. And that\u2019s also fine because you can also create your own chemistry with yourself, I suppose.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s so much more hard work and much less fun,\u201d adds Garfield, smiling. \u201cJust like self-pleasure.\u201d\nIn some ways, Garfield and Pugh were living alongside \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d and experiencing some of its chapters of life with their characters, albeit from different perspectives. When Almut is diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer, she is forced to make difficult decisions that weigh having children with her ambition as a chef.\n\u201cIf you want to be successful, if you want to actually give your career a good crack at it, you\u2019re going to be running through the time that is most optimum for having children,\u201d says Pugh. \u201cIt\u2019s stuff that I\u2019m now having to figure out since we made the movie, since the movie\u2019s coming out. It\u2019s for all ages of women that are trying to navigate this unbelievably tricky dilemma.\u201d\nSome of the challenges faced by Almut and Tobias were deeply familiar to the actors. Garfield\u2019s mother died of cancer in 2019. Others took more imagination. Neither Garfield or Pugh have children, but a lengthy birth scene, in a gas station bathroom, is the movie\u2019s most show-stopping moment. To experience Almut\u2019s cancer treatment, Pugh was convinced she needed to cut her hair. Crowley filmed Garfield cutting Pugh's hair for the scene. \n\u201cI wanted this to be gone now so I knew how she feels in these scenes that I\u2019ve read in the script and thought about, but that I can\u2019t imagine how she felt yet,\u201d Pugh says, pointing at her hair. \u201cI loved that day. It was a very powerful day.\u201d\nThe experience has left both actors trying to hold onto something from \u201cWe Live in Time.\u201d Garfield began the interview by opening up a book, offering a poem and then reading aloud Kabir\u2019s \u201cTo Be a Slave of Intensity.\u201d\n\u201cJust to remind myself that I\u2019m a person, I guess,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd because this film is about being as vitality alive as humanly possible. I think it\u2019s really hard to remember how to do that sometimes \u2014 a lot of the time. In fact, it\u2019s all set up against us doing it. So we need practices to keep us in touch with that.\u201d\nIf \u201cWe Live in Time\u201d is ultimately about making peace with the fleeting nature of all that\u2019s precious, and trying to appreciate those moments when they\u2019re happening, Garfield is doing his best to carry on that mentality and be grateful for the time he and Pugh had together.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/top-20-global-concert-tours-pollstar-114569524", "Title": "Top 20 Global Concert Tours from Pollstar", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:00 PM", "Content": "The Top 20 Global Concert Tours ranks artists by average box office gross per city and includes the average ticket price for shows Worldwide.

At first he\u2019s a millennial kid, then a college guy as the Twin Towers fall on 9/11.In time George \u2014 he\u2019s given no surname \u2014 graduates and struggles over what to do with the rest of his life. Fate actually treats him pretty well. He\u2019s an attractive, smart New Yorker; his family has some money; and he\u2019s often quite lucky.\nBut you wouldn\u2019t know it from his clownish, sour, perplexed, defeatist attitude. He\u2019s self-absorbed and self-disparaging, lovable and devilish \u2014 the list could go on.\nThe novel\u2019s author, Kate Greathead, is a gifted storyteller who reels off dialogue filled with wit and humor so well it makes page-turning a pleasure and \u201cThe Book of George\u201d an easy read.\nBut just as the indecisive George doesn\u2019t know where he is going in life, the reader doesn\u2019t know where his story is going either. Getting there, in a way, is the point.\nGeorge groans inwardly at the vacuous \u201csitcom-level banter\u201d that comes easily to him in conversation. Greathead is deft at dishing out such dialogue, too, and chapter after chapter, as George ages and a variety of crises large and small arise, this episodic novel seems a form of first-rate TV sitcom between covers.\nGeorge would be glad to call it \u201cthe show about nothing,\u201d similar to \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d Then he would cancel it.\nChoosing philosophy as his college major, George writes his thesis on Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th-century philosopher often seen as deeply pessimistic, much like George himself. Greathead, in the book\u2019s epigraph, quotes from an 1807 letter written by Johanna Schopenhauer to her 19-year-old son, Arthur, whom she says could be \u201ca credit to human society\u201d but is nevertheless \u201cirritating and unbearable.\u201d\nGeorge\u2019s own mother, Ellen, couldn\u2019t have said it better.\nAfter graduating, George eventually decides to become a writer. He starts a novel, but agonizes over the point of it. Early on, George says the book is \u201cabout a boy who grows up to be a man who is disappointed by life.\u201d The book shifts gears over time. It\u2019s title, finally, is \u201cAll For Naught.\u201d\nGeorge may be a doom-and-gloom sort, but that\u2019s not the case for Greathead\u2019s novel. Page after page, her writing is full of humor built around prickly sarcasm and woebegone twists in George\u2019s life.\nThere are serious, even sad, moments, plus plot turns that give the narrative depth. The reader may begin to feel an emotional tug. Jenny, a young woman who falls in love with George, lives with him for long, often agonizing stretches. They hit midlife as the pandemic hits the country, and Jenny brings real poignancy to the story.\nShe even grasps, finally, what George is all about.\n___\nAP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/book-review-paula-hawkins-returns-psychological-thriller-blue-114565592", "Title": "Book Review: Paula Hawkins returns with psychological thriller \u2019The Blue Hour'", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:38 AM", "Content": "Since bursting on the scene in 2015 with \u201cThe Girl on a Train,\u201d Paula Hawkins has established herself as a reliable writer of psychological thrillers set in the U.K. \u201cThe Blue Hour\u201d doesn\u2019t plow any new ground on that front, but it\u2019s a tight story with interesting characters that keeps you engaged until the end.Set mostly on an isolated Scottish island named Eris, where a famous painter and ceramicist named Vanessa Chapman once lived and worked, the story begins with a discovery. A bone in one of Chapman\u2019s sculptures, now owned by an estate, may be human. That revelation links together the three main characters \u2014 Chapman\u2019s longtime companion Grace Winters, a Chapman scholar who works for Fairburn Estate named James Becker, and Julian, Chapman\u2019s ex-husband who went missing 20 years ago. \nTold in the present, in flashbacks from two decades ago, and via excerpts from Chapman\u2019s diary, the plot moves along steadily. It\u2019s not really a keep-the-reader-guessing type of thriller, but more of a slow build that culminates in a shocking ending.\nHawkins weaves artistic themes and the creative process through the novel. Chapman\u2019s diary entries are filled with references to the landscape that inspires her \u2014 the \u201cterrible chaos\u201d of waves, the sky \u201cmiraculous azure or threatening gunmetal.\u201d The title refers to a time at dusk before the stars come out when the color leaches from the day but it\u2019s not yet full dark. Hawkins\u2019 prose often mirrors Chapman\u2019s artistic eye. Here\u2019s Becker\u2019s first glimpse of Grace: \u201cHer face is soft, cheeks relaxing gently into jowls, and her colors are muddied: from her bowl of hair to her slightly protuberant eyes\u2026 she is painted in varying shades of brown.\u201d\nThe novel\u2019s setting is a character unto itself. Eris is reachable from the mainland only when the tide is out, in two six-hour chunks each day, and so it\u2019s a fine place to bury secrets \u2014 physical and psychological. Learning those secrets is the fun of the novel, and there are few authors writing today who drip them out, page by excruciating page, like Hawkins.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/movie-review-piece-piece-odd-lego-doc-pharrell-114564922", "Title": "Movie Review: 'Piece by Piece,' a very odd Lego doc about Pharrell Williams snaps together somehow", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:15 AM", "Content": "A movie documentary that uses only Lego pieces might seem an unconventional choice. When that documentary is about renowned musician-producer Pharrell Williams, it's actually sort of on-brand.\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d is a bright, clever song-filled biopic that pretends it's a behind-the-scenes documentary using small plastic bricks, angles and curves to celebrate an artist known for his quirky soul. It is deep and surreal and often adorable. Is it high concept or low? Like Williams, it's a bit of both.\nDirector Morgan Neville \u2014 who has gotten more and more experimental exploring other celebrity lives like Fred Rogers in \u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?,\u201d\u201cRoadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain\u201d and \u201cSteve! (Martin): A Documentary in Two Pieces\u201d \u2014 this time uses real interviews but masks them under little Lego figurines with animated faces. Call this one a documentary in a million pieces.\nThe filmmakers try to explain their device \u2014 \u201cWhat if nothing is real? What if life is like a Lego set?\u201d Williams says at the beginning \u2014 but it's very tenuous. Just submit and enjoy the ride of a poor kid from Virginia Beach, Virginia, who rose to dominate music and become a creative director at Louis Vuitton.\nWilliams, by his own admission, is a little detached, a little odd. Music triggers colors in his brain \u2014 he has synesthesia, beautifully portrayed here \u2014 and it's his forward-looking musical brain that will make him a star, first as part of the producing team The Neptunes and then as an in-demand solo producer and songwriter.\nThere are highs and lows and then highs again. A verse Williams wrote for \u201cRump Shaker\u201d by Wreckx-N-Effect when he was making a living selling beats would lead to superstars demanding to work with him and partner Chad Hugo \u2014 Kendrick Lamar, Justin Timberlake, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes, Gwen Stefani, Missy Elliott and Jay-Z. All those superstars sit for interviews and have hysterically been depicted as Lego minifigures, right down to No Doubt's Adrian Young's mohawk. (Take my money, Lego.)\nWe also learn something about his wife, Helen, and his anguish over being a solo artist, an opportunity he spurned when it was his for the taking. Ultimately, we learn to understand his futuristic approach to fashion and music. \u201cWhat I am is a maverick,\u201d he says. No one will question him on that. \nThe 3D world the filmmakers have made is astonishing, with waves of clear Lego pieces washing up on a beach made of slats of Lego baseplates and Williams' collection of cool beats depicted as bouncing bricks with lights in them. There's Lego McDonald's nuggets, Lego pretzels, singing Lego fish and a Lego Anna Wintour, chilly and haughty in plastic, too.\nLego, while seemingly a restrictive medium \u2014 the hands are clips and everyone's walking is robotic since there are no Lego knees \u2014 can also, apparently, in the right hands soar, and here they do, with Williams in one gorgeous dream sequence watching the Earth's lights as an distant astronaut. It is when the filmmakers make Lego appear as water and music that are their crowning achievements. (Special kudos to the team that made Lego champagne bubbles.)\nMusic credits are notoriously hard to pin down \u2014 Williams claims to have created McDonald's notoriously mysterious jingle \u201cI'm lovin' it\u201d \u2014 and the filmmakers try to cover any misinformation with a simple disclaimer in the end credits: \u201cNot everything in this film is 100% accurate. For example, Pharrell never went to space.\u201d\nThere are also some extraordinary moments that snap by but likely took months to make, like a Lego glimpse of the \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the Lincoln Memorial and protest footage from Black Lives Matter figurines shouting \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d\nThe documentary lags a little during Williams' way up and rushes the years on top, although recreations of some of the music videos he fueled are too funny. Why he and Hugo broke up is papered over and the filmmakers struggle to find an ending, making several stutter steps.\n\u201cI think we're done,\u201d are the last words we hear as the filmmakers finally give up. But they've left behind a trippy, sweet portrait of a genius, forever in building blocks.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/guster-avett-brothers-florence-welch-helping-bring-alt-114564923", "Title": "Guster, Avett Brothers and Florence Welch are helping bring alt-rock to the musical theater stage", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:10 AM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- Ryan Miller, lead singer of alternative rock band Guster, has a new gig that even he's a little surprised about: Musical theater songwriter.

This is not a joke,\u201d it reads. \u201cMust bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed.\u201d\nAside from the time-travel silliness, the film and musical is about the fading dreams of aspiring professionals in their 20s and 30s who see diminished opportunities and want to go back to the comfort of the past.\nMiller initially had no intentions of making musical theater. When not touring with his four-piece band, he scores films, appears on podcasts and even starred in his own PBS series. Broadway or Broadway-adjacent didn't appeal.\nMiller, who lives in Vermont, was simply turned off by the sheer amount of time it usually took: Fellow Vermont creators Ana\u00efs Mitchell's \u201cHadestown\u201d took 14 years and Trey Anastasio's \u201cHands on a Hardbody\u201d took 10 years and closed after less than a month.\nBut Miller found himself gradually sucked in and enjoying a timeline that was accelerated. He was originally asked just to attend a workshop performance of \u201cSafety Not Guaranteed\u201d studded with Guster songs \u2014 basically, a Guster jukebox \u2014 and loved it. \u201cHave I just been like a closeted theater kid my whole life?\u201d he asked himself.\nSoon he was writing original songs for it. He was a natural, since he had scored the film, knew the characters and the emotional beats. He wrote five new stage songs in a month and sent them to book writer Nick Blaemire.\n\u201cI remember after I finished that fifth song, I sent it to Nick, I was like, \u2018Man, really fell in love with this.' Like something happened and I\u2019m going to be really bummed if I don\u2019t get to just see it once.'\u201d\nMiller then went on a writing tear, offering some 15 new songs in place of the Guster ones. \u201cThis was the rule: I was like, \u2018Just let me beat it. If I don\u2019t beat it, we\u2019ll all know and that\u2019s it.\u2019\"\nOne new song \u2014 \u201cI Wanna Go Back\u201d \u2014 shows Miller clearly having fun, with the lyrics: \"We're losing our hair/It doesn't seem fair/All the best of our days are behind us and gone/Xbox/cheap buzz/tan lines/peach fuzz.\u201d \nOnly three Guster songs \u2014 including \u201cOne Man Wrecking Machine\u201d \u2014 made the cut. The rest are from Miller, who relished the storytellers' task of creating songs specifically tailored for the characters and moments. \n\"It\u2019s been like, one of the greatest thrills, I think, of my artistic career to have been brought/stumbled/actively weaseled my way into this world. And I\u2019m totally smitten,\u201d he says.\nMore and more alt-rockers may follow, attracted by the chance to show their multi-hyphenate-ness and the constancy. No matter how successful a rock band is, life on the road means one or two nights in a city; a stage show, on the other hand, is more like a residency.\nMiller says he's also embraced the narrowness of the role. When he's writing for Guster, the song can be about anything.

Some of the entries, lasting just two or three pages, feel incomplete.The mood here is never too serious, with musings on \u201cBlade Runner\u201d and a retelling of \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d that has the White Rabbit bounding through southeast London. There\u2019s not one, but two prose poems structured in an \u201cA to Z\u201d style. The collection brings together many of Levy\u2019s pieces that were previously published elsewhere. Several were written as forwards or introductions to works by other authors, perhaps explaining why their audience never seems to be the reader at hand.\nThe collection might be best for the Levy diehards who don\u2019t want to miss any of her writing that happens between longer works. And the writing here is not the problem \u2013 Levy is engaging on subjects from lemons to Sigmund Freud. Her most moving work is in her personal stories, from the titular essay to her recollection, just three pages long, of meeting the eyes of a colleague whose wife had recently died. It\u2019s mainly the purpose of the book that feels askew or absent here. We\u2019re left waiting for Levy to really dig in.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/nicholas-alexander-chavez-plays-lyle-menendez-priest-tv-114563750", "Title": "Nicholas Alexander Chavez plays Lyle Menendez and a priest on TV.

For \u201cMonsters,\u201d Chavez's prep was different because he was playing a real person and could watch old court videos.\nIn 1996, Lyle and his younger brother Erik (played by Cooper Koch) were sentenced to life in prison for the 1989 killing of their parents, Jose and Kitty in their Beverly Hills home. The brothers alleged they were sexually abused by both parents for years and feared for their lives.

After reconnecting with her friend Ingrid, played by Julianne Moore, Martha persuades her to stay and keep her company before she goes through with her decision.\nBeyond the film\u2019s narrative, Swinton said she believes individuals should have a say in their own living and dying. She acknowledges that she has personally witnessed a friend\u2019s compassionate departure.\n\u201cIn my own life I had the great good fortune to be asked by someone in Martha\u2019s position to be his Ingrid (Julianne Moore),\u201d Swinton said.\nShe said that experience shaped her attitude about life and death: \u201cNot only my capacity to be witness to other people in that situation, but my own living and my own dying.\u201d\nSwinton spoke to The Associated Press about \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d Almod\u00f3var and he idea of letting people die on their own terms. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.\nSWINTON: I felt really blessed by the opportunity. So many of us have been in the situation Julianne Moore\u2019s character finds herself in, being asked to be the witness of someone who is dying. Whether that wanting to orchestrate their own dismount or not, to be in that position to be a witness is something that I\u2019ve been privileged to experience many times in my life since I was quite young.\nSWINTON: It\u2019s a really beautiful poem to a possibility of an attitude. I think (my character) Martha\u2019s attitude to her own living is really inspiring. I would like to think that this is a really generous proposal and that it might inspire people to just know that it\u2019s possible to face their own death with dignity, which is really what we\u2019re talking about.\nIt really is a fool\u2019s errand to think we can avoid thinking about death because it\u2019s not just unlucky people who get ill or who die. It\u2019s an inevitability. And so we might as well, you know, embrace it. And by the way, the more we embrace it, I would suggest the more we will enjoy our living.\nSWINTON: There are many countries in the world where it is not criminal to assist somebody\u2019s active will to orchestrate their own dying. And in the United States, there are 10 states where it is not criminal, where it\u2019s possible for two doctors to assist in the active will of a patient to take charge of their own dying. And it\u2019s there are just other places where and New York State, which is where our film is set, is not one of those 10 states. And there are all sorts of people, very wise and very compassionate people, very educated and very enlightened people, in my view, who are actively campaigning to broaden this acceptance.\nSWINTON: I\u2019d had a taste of it with short film, \u201cThe Human Voice.\u201d We made it in the middle of COVID. We shot it in nine days. Super, super fast\u2026 And I thought that Pedro was working very fast because it was a short film and because we were in the middle of COVID. No, no, that is the way Pedro works. I now discover super, super fast two takes, if you\u2019re lucky.\nSWINTON: I mean, it really helps always when you know the work of a filmmaker as well as it\u2019s possible to know Pedro\u2019s work. I\u2019ve known it since I was a student, and I\u2019ve loved it always. It\u2019s like a country. I love to go to the world of Almod\u00f3var and it\u2019s not Spain, it\u2019s somewhere else. It\u2019s his environment. So, stepping into the frame of a filmmaker who creates that environment is always a bit of a trip.\nSWINTON: It\u2019s still a bit of a shock to us. When you\u2019re in an audience, that\u2019s the first indication of whether the souffle has risen or not. Apparently 18-and-a-half minutes is a record when you\u2019re standing next to Pedro Almod\u00f3var and you know that that is 18-and-a-half minutes of people really lovingly appreciating him. It pretty much doesn\u2019t get much better than that.\nSWINTON: Not mine. To be honest, I\u2019m ignorant really, of that in particular. I have other things on my mind. That\u2019s like the weather. It\u2019s like saying, do you have the weather in three months on your mind? Well, no. Let\u2019s wait and see. Let\u2019s keep it real. Let\u2019s keep it today.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/robert-coover-innovative-author-teacher-dies-92-114550280", "Title": "Robert Coover, innovative author and teacher, dies at 92", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 6, 2024, 8:21 PM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- Robert Coover, the exuberant and rule-defying fiction writer and educator who devised new adventures for literature through such works as \"The Babysitter\" and \"The Public Burning\" and through his decades on the faculty of Brown University, has died. He was 92. Coover died surrounded by family on Saturday at a care home in Warwick, England, his daughter Sara Caldwell told The Associated Press on Sunday. Caldwell, an author and filmmaker, said he had been in declining health in recent months. \nThe writer T.C. Boyle said on X that Coover had been \u201ca friend and mentor to me since I was in my early twenties. His first collection, \u2018Pricksongs and Descants,\u2019 opened up a new world for me.\u201d\nCoover was often grouped with William Gass, John Barth and other authors of post-modern or \"meta-fiction\" of the 1960s and '70s. They challenged and sometimes bludgeoned conventional storytelling and grammar, whether through experiments with language, the parody of fairy tales, mysteries and other literary genres or the self-conscious exploration of the writing process. Coover's trademarks included macabre humor, graphic sex, broad takes on everything from baseball to small towns and an encyclopedic range of cultural references.\n\"Robert Coover writes from life, but not the one he has lived out in the world,\" author Ben Marcus once wrote of him. \"He writes from his life as a reader of narratives. His personal experience, which he draws on for his work, is the experience he has had inside of texts. He did not grow up in Iowa, but in Ovid's 'Metamorphoses.' He did not suffer first love in the mid-west of America, but inside the Greek myths, or Aesop's fables, or 'The Decameron.'\"\nRarely without something to say, he wrote dozens of novels, stories and plays. His notable works included \"The Babysitter,\" in which a night out for the parents multiplies into a funhouse of alternative realities; \"You Must Remember This,\" an X-rated imagining of the leads in \"Casablanca,\" and the novel \"Huck Out West,\" in which Coover continued the adventures of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.\n\"A lesson I learned from reading (Thomas Pynchon's) 'V' has stuck with me all my life: All my work is basically comic,\" he told the Boston Globe in 2014. \"That's the only thing I have ever written. Even though they're not always viewed as such, the books are all meant as comic works.\"\nCoover's most controversial work was the 1977 novel \"The Public Burning,\" a warp-speed satire of the 1953 executions of convicted communist spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg that publishers hesitated to take on for fear of legal action by Richard Nixon, Roy Cohn and other then still-living historical figures who appear in the book. Coover alternated chapters about the Rosenbergs with the thoughts of then-Vice President Nixon, who laments his subservient role in the Eisenhower administration and confides to a growing sexual attraction between himself and Ethel Rosenberg.\n\"I was Eisenhower's salesman in the Cloakrooms, that was my job,\" Coover's Nixon explains. \"I was the political broker between the patsies and the Neanderthals, I had to cool the barnburners, soften up the hardshells, keep the hunkers and cowboys in line, mollify the soreheads and baby tinhorn egos. I was the flak runner, the wheelhorse, I had to mend the fences and bind up the wounds.\"\nCoover's influence was on the page and in the classroom. At Brown, where he was on the faculty from 1981 to 2012, those he taught included Rick Moody and Sam Lipsyte. Coover and such fellow professors as John Hawkes inspired students to experiment and break away from the kind of spare, realistic style \u2014 as exemplified by Ernest Hemingway \u2014 that was the standard in mainstream American fiction. \nFor Coover, anything seemed possible. He was an early believer that the written word could be integrated with music and film and digital technology and championed what he called \"Cave Writing,\" which included placing students in a virtual reality simulator. Before e-books were widely available, he helped found \"electronic literature,\" storytelling designed specifically for digital devices.\n\"What I saw quite clearly in the '80s, before the internet, was that the whole world was shifting toward digital formats, and that it didn't matter whether it's movies or writing or whatever,\" he told The Believer in 2015. \"It was something that was coming.\"\nHis honors included the William Faulkner Award for best debut fiction, given for his 1966 book \"The Origin of the Brunists.\u201d He also received the Rea Award for excellence in short story writing and the Clifton Fadiman Medal for fiction writers deserving of more recognition. The American Academy of Arts and Letters voted him in as a member and even had a prize named for him, the Robert Coover Award for an outstanding work of electronic literature.\nCoover is survived by Pilar Sans Coover, the tapestry artist he married in 1959, along with the couple\u2019s three children: Caldwell, Roderick Coover and Diana Hancox, who lived near their parents\u2019 care home in England. Caldwell said he had seven grandchildren, three great-granddaughters, and a great-grandson due this month who is set to be named after him.\nBorn in Charles City, Iowa, he graduated from Indiana University in 1953, served in the Navy and wrote for the Evergreen Review and other publications before completing his first novel. He would recall a night in Chicago in 1960 as an epiphany, when he was reading Saul Bellow's prize-winning \"The Adventures of Augie March\" and William Gaddis' experimental classic \"The Recognitions.\"\n\"I really loved 'Augie March.' The opening section, at least. But somewhere in the middle of the book the experience totally transformed, I was really ticked off. It was bad and getting worse. And I was really catching on to 'The Recognitions.' I took 'Augie March' and threw it across the room, and that was the last I saw of it,\" he told The Guardian in 2011.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/donald-glover-cancels-childish-gambino-tour-dates-after-114545553", "Title": "Donald Glover cancels Childish Gambino tour dates over health issue", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 6, 2024, 2:47 PM", "Content": "Donald Glover has canceled the remaining dates of Childish Gambino\u2019s North American and European tour.The musician, actor and \u201cAtlanta\u201d creator announced on Friday that he recently discovered an ailment that required surgery.

The collapse was swift and has many in the industry wondering: How did the highly anticipated sequel to an Oscar-winning, billion-dollar film with the same creative team go wrong?\nJust three weeks ago, tracking services pegged the movie for a $70 million debut, which would still have been down a fair amount from \u201cJoker\u2019s\u201d record-breaking $96.2 million launch in Oct. 2019. Reviews were mixed out of the Venice Film Festival, where it premiered in competition like the first movie and even got a 12-minute standing ovation.\nBut the homecoming glow was short-lived, and the fragile foundation would crumble in the coming weeks with its Rotten Tomatoes score dropping from 63% at Venice to 33% by its first weekend in theaters. Perhaps even more surprising were the audience reviews: Ticket buyers polled on opening night gave the film a deadly D CinemaScore. Exit polls from PostTrak weren\u2019t any better. It got a meager half star out of five possible.\n\"That\u2019s a double whammy that\u2019s very difficult to recover from,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cThe biggest issue of all is the reported budget. A $40 or $50 million opening for a less expensive movie would be a solid debut.\"\n\u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\u201d cost at least twice as much as the first film to produce, though reported figures vary at exactly how pricey it was to make. Phillips told Variety that it was less than the reported $200 million; Others have it pegged at $190 million. Warner Bros. released the film in 4,102 locations in North America. About 12.5% of its domestic total came from 415 IMAX screens.\nInternationally, it's earned $81.1 million from 25,788 screens, bringing its total global earnings estimate to $121.1 million. In the next two weeks, \u201cJoker 2\u201d will also open in Japan and China.\nSecond place went to Universal and DreamWorks Animation's\u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d which added $18.7 million in its second weekend, bringing its domestic total to nearly $64 million. Globally, it's made over $100 million. Warner Bros.' \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice\" took third place in weekend five, Paramount's \u201cTransformers One\u201d landed in fourth and Universal and Blumhouse's \u201cSpeak No Evil\u201d rounded out the top five.\nThe other big new release of the weekend, Lionsgate's \u201cWhite Bird,\u201d flopped with just $1.5 million from just over 1,000 locations, despite an A+ CinemaScore.\nOverall, the weekend is up from the same frame last year, but \u201cJoker's\u201d start is an unwelcome twist for theater owners hoping to narrow the box office deficit. \nPhillips and star Joaquin Phoenix have said they aspired to make something as \u201caudacious\u201d as the first film. The sequel added Lady Gaga into the fold, as a Joker superfan, and delved further into the mind of Arthur Fleck, imprisoned at Arkham and awaiting trial for the murders he committed in the first. It\u2019s also a musical, with elaborately imagined song and dance numbers to old standards. Gaga even released a companion album called \u201c'Harlequin,\u201d alongside the film.\nIn his review for The Associated Press, Jake Coyle wrote that \u201cPhillips has followed his very antihero take on the Joker with a very anti-sequel. It combines prison drama, courthouse thriller and musical, and yet turns out remarkably inert given how combustible the original was.\u201d\nThe sequel has already been the subject of many think pieces, some who posit that the sequel was deliberately alienating fans of the first movie. In cruder terms, it\u2019s been called a \u201cmiddle finger.\u201d But fans often ignore the advice of critics, especially when it comes to opening their wallets to see revered comic book characters on the big screen.\n\u201cThey took a swing for the fences,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBut except for a couple of outliers, audiences in 2024 seem to want to know what they\u2019re getting when they\u2019re going to the theater. They want the tried and true, the familiar.\u201d\nIt has some high-profile defenders too: Francis Ford Coppola, who last week got his own D+ CinemaScore for his pricey, ambitious and divisive film \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d entered the Joker chat with an Instagram post.\n\u201c@ToddPhillips films always amaze me and I enjoy them thoroughly,\u201d Coppola wrote. \u201cEver since the wonderful \u2018The Hangover\u2019 he\u2019s always one step ahead of the audience never doing what they expect.\u201d\n\u201cMegalopolis,\u201d meanwhile, dropped a terminal 74% in its second weekend with just over $1 million, bringing its total just shy of $6.5 million against a $120 million budget. \nDeadline editor Anthony D\u2019Alessandro thinks the problem started with the idea to make the Joker sequel a musical. \u201cNo fan of the original movie wanted to see a musical sequel,\u201d he wrote on Saturday.\nThe first film was also divisive and the subject of much discourse, then about whether it might send the wrong message to the wrong type of person. And yet people still flocked to see what the fuss was about. \u201cJoker\u201d went on to pick up 11 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director, and three wins. It also made over $1 billion and was the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, until this summer when Marvel's \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\" took the crown.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

The discussion with Harris was on the tame side for the show, with the vice president keeping her message focused, in part, on the value of ignoring people who have doubted her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear no. I urge all the \u2018Daddy Gang,\u2019 don\u2019t hear no, just don\u2019t hear it,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important not to let other people define you.\u201d\nThe interview was part of a broader media outreach effort by Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, as the Democrats seek to boost their support in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.\nHarris has been criticized for not doing more media interviews. \nOn the podcast, the Democratic nominee largely stuck to her usual messaging on abortion, and said that in her travels she's seen that even people who have strong opposition to abortion tell her they \u201care now seeing what\u2019s happening and saying \u2018Hmm, I didn\u2019t intend for all this to happen' \u201d when they see the health problems arising since Roe v. Wade was repealed.\nHarris dinged Trump as she has in recent speeches, leaning in on his integrity and saying \u201cthis guy is full of lies\u201d when he talks about abortion and other issues. She dismissed Vance\u2019s comments about \u201cchildless cat ladies\u201d as \u201cmean, and mean-spirited.\u201d\nTrump has continued to stress that abortion policy should be left to the states and that doctors have a duty to provide emergency care to women whose lives are in danger. Vance, for his part, has said his remark about childless women were misinterpreted and that he wants to support families. \nThere's much more to come from Harris and Walz. \nHarris has taped an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern\u2019s satellite radio show, ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d and \u201cThe Late Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s ABC show on Monday.\nIn a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d excerpt released Sunday, Harris navigated around a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was \u201ca real close ally,\u201d saying that \u201cThe better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.\u201d\nAnd nearly a week after his verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and to \u201cown up\u201d to past misstatements.\nWalz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.\nWalz said Sunday that \u201cspecific operations will be dealt with at the time\u201d and he spoke of \u201dconsequences for what they do.\" \nHe said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.\nWalz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it \"puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers.\u201d \nTrump has said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law, and during the interview Sunday, Walz was asked whether he was calling that \u201ca flat-out lie.\u201d\n\u201cYes ... of course,\u201d Walz said.\nWalz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements related to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.\n\u201cI will own up when I misspeak,\u201d Walz said. \u201cI will own up when I make a mistake.\u201d\nHe said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could be restrictions on the infertility treatments, like the intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.\n\u201cI think they\u2019re probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,\" Walz said. \"So I think folks know who I am.\u201d\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/magical-flotilla-hot-air-balloons-flight-international-fiesta-114530543", "Title": "'Magical' flotilla of hot air balloons take flight at international fiesta amid warm temperatures", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 5, 2024, 1:44 PM", "Content": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- A flotilla of hot air balloons ascended into a clear desert sky on Saturday to kick off a colorful mass ascension at the 52nd annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta.The nine-day gathering draws hundreds of thousands of spectators and pilots to New Mexico each fall for the rare opportunity to be within arm\u2019s reach as the giant balloons are unpacked and inflated.\nBalloons took flight to screams of delight after a brief weather delay and were spirited away by a gentle breeze.
