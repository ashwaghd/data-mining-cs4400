In a federal complaint, filed Friday in New York, McDonald's accused the companies of anticompetitive measures such as collectively limiting supply to boost prices and charge \u201cillegally inflated\u201d amounts.\nThis collusion caused the beef market to become \u201ca monopoly in which direct purchasers were forced to buy at prices dictated by (the meat packers),\u201d McDonald's suit reads \u2014 later noting that the injury it has sustained as one of those buyers is what \u201cantitrust laws were designed to prevent.\u201d\nMcDonald's alleges that the meat packers' conspiracy dates back nearly a decade, at least as early as January 2015, and continues today. Its suit argues these companies' actions violate the Sherman Act, a federal antitrust law.\nTyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. But these companies have faced federal probes and allegations of price fixing before.\nLawsuits filed by grocery stores, ranchers, restaurants and wholesalers have piled up over the years. Some litigation is still pending, although meat packers and processers have opened their wallets in the past.\nIn 2022, for example, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement in a similar beef price-fixing lawsuit. And Tyson agreed to pay $221.5 million back in 2021, after facing class-action claims that alleged purposely inflated chicken prices.\nSuch settlements did not include admissions of wrongdoing, however. Meat processors have previously maintained that larger supply and demand factors out of their control, not anticompetitive behavior, has caused prices to go up. Meat processing plants were occassionally closed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, and the industry has also faced labor shortages that were worsened by the pandemic.\nStill, lawsuits like the one from McDonald's point to increased profit margins during the alleged time of conspiracy \u2014 and argue that overall concentration of the market helps facilitate collusion.\n\u201cConspiracies are easier to organize and sustain when only a few firms control a large share of the market,\u201d McDonald's suit reads. Data from recent years has showed that Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef control more than 80% of the U.S. beef market combined, the suit notes.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/chief-operating-officer-truth-socials-parent-company-resigns-114495220", "Title": "Chief operating officer of Truth Social's parent company resigns", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 4, 2024, 8:24 AM", "Content": "The chief operating officer of Truth Social's parent company has resigned and the company must hand over almost 800,000 shares to one of its investors as part of a court ruling, according to a regulatory filing.COO Andrew Northwall resigned from Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. late last month, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, adding that the company plans to \u201ctransition his duties internally.\u201d No further details were provided about the resignation.

The trend carries uncertain implications for the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, since persistent concern about inflation could hurt Harris but recent improvement in sentiment may blunt some of the negative impact.\n\u201cInflation is really something that takes people a long time to feel better about,\u201d Chris Jackson, senior vice president of public affairs for Ipsos in the U.S., told ABC News.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly better for Harris to have inflation coming down than going up, but it\u2019d be better for her if it came down six months earlier,\u201d Jackson added. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s very much a toss-up.\u201d\nInflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of about 9% in 2022, hovering right near the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%.\nSome household staples have shown major progress. Gas prices have declined sharply in recent months. While food prices are rising at a slower pace than the overall inflation rate, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. By contrast, housing prices continue to climb at a rate more than double overall price increases, the data found.\nWhile overall inflation has returned to normal, the progress cannot undo a leap in prices that dates back to the pandemic. Since the outset of 2021, consumer prices have skyrocketed more than 20%.\nThat accumulated rise in prices helps explain why people think inflation remains high, even if it has fallen to a level widely viewed by economists as normal, said Sofia Baig, an economist at the polling firm Morning Consult.\n\u201cThere's a mismatch of where people think inflation is and where economists think inflation is,\u201d Baig said. \u201cMany people seem not to see inflation has come down because prices are so much higher.\u201d\nEventually consumers get used to elevated price levels in the aftermath of high price increases, but the process takes up to three years starting at peak inflation, Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a former special adviser for economic policy to the White House National Economic Council under Biden, told ABC News. Roughly two years and four months have passed since inflation reached its peak in June 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where inflation concerns are starting to recede,\u201d Neale said.\nAttitudes about the economy have improved since 2022, data shows. Consumer sentiment ticked upward in August, the most recent month on record, but attitudes remain well below pre-pandemic levels, a University of Michigan survey found.\nPartisanship also plays a significant role in how individuals perceive inflation, making dissatisfaction more persistent among conservatives than liberals, experts said.\nRoughly 80% of adults who consume conservative media said they had not seen costs for groceries or gasoline go down, while 17% had seen a decrease, the Ipsos survey in September showed. For adults who consume mainstream media, 46% said they had not seen prices for those items fall, while 47% said they had seen such a decline, the poll found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate people\u2019s feelings about the economy from their feelings about politics,\u201d said Jackson.\nStill, the prevalence of stubborn perceptions of inflation could hurt Harris, though the uptick in consumer sentiment could limit the damage, some experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think things will change in time for the election,\u201d said Baig, but she noted the improvement in attitudes among consumers. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing if you're the incumbent party but it\u2019s still not where it used to be.\u201d\nThe exact trajectory for prices and the economy remains uncertain, experts said, leaving open the question of how it will factor into the election.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/imminent-dockworkers-strike-raise-holiday-prices-experts/story?id=114346872", "Title": "Dockworkers hit picket lines in historic US port strike that could impact prices", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 2, 2024, 6:11 PM", "Content": "Tens of thousands of U.S. dockworkers walked off the job early Tuesday morning, clogging dozens of ports along the East and Gulf coasts and potentially raising consumer prices ahead of the holiday season.The ports account for more than half of the nation's container imports, facilitating the transport of everything from toys to fresh fruit to nuclear reactors, JPMorgan senior equity analyst Brian Ossenbeck said in a report shared with ABC News.\nPresident Joe Biden released a statement on Tuesday emphasizing the strong profits enjoyed by shipping firms in recent years, as well as the sacrifices made by dockworkers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden called for a fair offer from the U.S. Maritime Alliance, or USMX, an organization bargaining on behalf of the dockworkers' employers.\n\"It is time for USMX to negotiate a fair contract with the longshoremen that reflects the substantial contribution they've been making to our economic comeback,\" Biden said in the statement.\nThe International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) confirmed to ABC News early Tuesday that the union's first coastwide strike in nearly 50 years was underway. The statement said that \"tens of thousands of ILA rank-and-file members\" started to set up picket lines at shipping ports up and down the Atlantic and Gulf coasts as of 12:01 a.m.\n\"We are prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve,\" ILA President Harold Daggett said.\nUSMX said Wednesday it was focused on ratifying a new contract \"that addresses all the critical issues the parties need to bargain.\"\n\"Reaching an agreement will require negotiating -- and our full focus is on how to return to the table to further discuss these vital components, many of which are intertwined,\" it said in a statement. \"We cannot agree to preconditions to return to bargaining -- but we remain committed to bargaining in good faith to address the ILA's demands and USMX's concerns.\nA top Biden administration official said late Tuesday that the U.S. Maritime Alliance needed to put forward a fair offer to union dockworkers.\n\"The parties need to get back to the negotiating table, and that must begin with these giant shipping magnates acknowledging that if they can make record profits, their workers should share in that economic success,\" Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said.\nSu said she spent \"hours on the phone and in meetings\" with both parties over the last week, urging them to find a way to reach a fair contract.\nA prolonged work stoppage of several weeks or months could rekindle inflation for some goods and trigger layoffs at manufacturers as raw materials dry up, experts said.\n\"A strike would be very, very disruptive,\" said Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University who closely tracks imports, told ABC News.\n\"You can't take all this freight and either send it to other ports or put it on airplanes,\" Miller added. \"There is no plan B.\"\nThe ILA, the union representing East Coast and Gulf Coast dockworkers, is seeking higher wages and a ban on the use of some automated equipment.\n\"ILA longshore workers deserve to be compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce moving and growing,\" the ILA told ABC News in a statement on Monday. \"Meanwhile, ILA dedicated longshore workers continue to be crippled by inflation due to USMX's unfair wage packages.\"\nBiden retains the power to prevent or halt a strike under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to Biden on Monday urging the White House to intervene, which it has previously said it will not do. The White House told ABC News in a statement that it has been in contact with both the union and management in recent days.\n\"This weekend, senior officials have been in touch with USMX representatives urging them to come to a fair agreement fairly and quickly \u2013 one that reflects the success of the companies. Senior officials have also been in touch with the ILA to deliver the same message,\" White House spokesperson Robyn Patterson said.\nA prolonged East Coast and Gulf Coast port strike could moderately increase prices for a range of goods, experts told ABC News. That upward pressure on prices would result from a shortage of products caught up in the supply chain blockage, leaving too many dollars chasing after too few items, they added.\nFood products are especially vulnerable to an uptick in prices, since food could spoil if suppliers sent the products ahead of time to minimize the strike impact, as they have done for some other goods, Adam Kamins, a senior director of economic research at Moody's Analytics, told ABC News.\nAdditionally, a significant share of the nation's imported auto parts pass through the ports impacted by a potential strike, which could cause an increase in vehicle prices if the strike persists.\nPrice increases have slowed dramatically from a peak in 2022, but inflation remains higher than the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2%. A strike could prevent further progress, according to Kamins.\n\"We're not talking about prices skyrocketing by any means, but I think it halts the momentum we've had over the last year or so getting inflation back in the bottle,\" he said.\nIn 2002, a strike among workers at West Coast ports lasted 11 days before then-President George W. Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act and ended the standoff. However, the last time East Coast and Gulf Coast workers went on strike, in 1977, the work stoppage lasted seven weeks.\nTuesday's potential work stoppage follows high-profile strikes undertaken last year by auto workers as well as Hollywood writers and actors. Most recently, 33,000 Boeing workers walked off the job in early September, demanding better pay and retirement benefits.\n\"Trade unions all over the country have been going out on strike,\" Sriram Narayanan, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told ABC News. \"We're seeing that happen now at the ports.\"\nAhead of the historic strike, the president of the Teamsters labor union, Sean O'Brien, released a letter of solidarity to the International Longshoreman's Association, saying, \"The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, including our members in the freight industry, stand in full solidarity with the International Longshoremen's Association as they fight for a fair and just contract with the ocean carriers represented by USMX.\"\n\"Don't forget --Teamsters do not cross picket lines. The Teamsters Union is 100 percent committed to standing with our Longshoremen brothers and sisters until they win the contract they deserve,\" O'Brien said.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/musks-reinstated-brazil-after-complying-supreme-court-demands-114618439", "Title": "Musk's X to be reinstated in Brazil after complying with Supreme Court demands", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:32 PM", "Content": "SAO PAULO -- The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X\u00b4s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public.Elon Musk\u2019s X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people \u2014 and one of X\u2019s biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X\u2019s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers.\nDespite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension.\n\u201cThe resumption of (X)\u2019s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,\u201d de Moraes said in the court document.\nX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nJust two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. \nBrazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action \u2014 particularly, in X\u2019s case, the takedown of accounts. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was first named X\u2019s legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sep. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry.\nIn an apparent effort to shield Concei\u00e7\u00e3o from potential violations by X \u2014 and risking arrest \u2014 a clause has been written into Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X\u2019s behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company\u2019s filing.\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. \u201cSomething great is on its way,\u201d the top of the site\u2019s main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy. \nAt three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company\u2019s offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Concei\u00e7\u00e3o nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP.\nThere is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil\u2019s regulatory policies concerning their businesses,\u201d Silva added.\nIndeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward.\n\u201cThe concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,\u201d he said.\nSome of Brazilian X\u2019s users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta\u2019s Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It\u2019s unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country.\nBrazil was not the first country to ban X \u2014 far from it \u2014 but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest.\nX\u2019s dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company\u2019s dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta\u2019s Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government\u2019s requests to take down posts related to farmers\u2019 protests that rocked the country.\nMusk\u2019s decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn\u2019t surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer\u2019s analyst for Latin America and Spain.\n\u201cThe move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,\u201d Ceurvels said. \u201cAlthough X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hunt-gasoline-adding-floridians-anxiety-milton-nears-114609527", "Title": "The hunt for gasoline is adding to Floridians\u2019 anxiety as Milton nears", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 2:02 PM", "Content": "TAMPA, Fla. -- Florida gas stations struggled to keep up with demand Tuesday as long lines and empty pumps compounded the stress for residents planning to hunker down or flee as Hurricane Milton approached the state's western coast.

They have very different plans for doing it.", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 2, 2024, 2:34 PM", "Content": "In the final weeks of the campaign, former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have sought to best each other on the all-important issue of the economy, which many voters rank as their top concern.Both candidates have made manufacturing a centerpiece of their plans, but their respective approaches feature stark differences.\nHarris aims to close corporate tax loopholes and throw government support behind the production of critical goods. By contrast, Trump wants to protect domestic manufacturers with tariffs on foreign products while cutting corporate taxes and easing regulations.\nManufacturing accounts for about 10% of U.S. gross domestic product and an even smaller share of the nation's jobs. But the sector bears outsized importance since the production of essential goods holds national security implications and many manufacturing workers live in key swing states, experts said.\n\"There's a belief that manufacturing is special,\" Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who studies trade policy, told ABC News.\nHere's what to know about where Harris and Trump stand on manufacturing, and what experts think of their respective plans:\nOn the campaign trail, Trump talks about tariffs more than just about any other policy proposal. The tax on imports makes up a key part of his plan for revitalizing manufacturing, alongside a lower tax burden for companies that he says would boost production and hiring.\nTrump has promised a sharp escalation of tariffs enacted during his first term. Trump has proposed tariffs of between 60% and 100% on Chinese goods. A set of far-reaching tariffs would also include a tax as high as 20% on all imported products.\nIn theory, a tax on imports would give domestic producers a leg up in competition with foreign manufacturers, Christopher Conlon, a professor of economics at New York University who studies trade, told ABC News.\n\"His plan is based on the idea that foreign competitors are pricing their products too low and what we need to do is erect a wall of tariff barriers around the U.S.,\" Conlon told ABC News.\nAn escalation of tariffs could expand certain areas of U.S. manufacturing vulnerable to foreign competition, which could result in added jobs at companies protected by the policy, experts said.\nThe economy added manufacturing over the first few years of his presidency, though the pandemic wiped out much of those gains.\nExperts cautioned about a spike in input costs and consumer prices that could end up hindering many manufacturers and hammering household budgets. Evidence indicates that the Trump tax cut did not provide a significant boost for the economy, they added.\nU.S. manufacturers of sophisticated products like automobiles and advanced medical equipment often import raw materials. A tariff would likely raise costs for those companies and risk making them less competitive on the global market, Conlon said. While adding jobs at some manufacturers, the policy could cause layoffs at others.\n\"Nobody seems to have shared that wisdom with the Trump campaign,\" Conlon said.\nA similar cause and effect applies to prices paid by everyday people for imported goods at the grocery or department store. Broad tariffs on foreign goods would likely force importing companies to raise prices and reignite inflation, experts said.\nIn a statement to ABC News, the Trump campaign said its manufacturing plan would create jobs and cut taxes.\n\"President Trump is a businessman who built the greatest economy in American history, and certainly doesn't need economics lessons from a professor who has never created jobs or built anything in his life,\" Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.\n\"President Trump successfully imposed tariffs on China in his first term AND cut taxes for hardworking Americans here at home -- and he will do it again in his second term. President Trump's plan will result in millions of jobs and hundreds of billions of dollars returning home from China to America,\" the statement added in part.\nHarris has proposed a different approach to manufacturing that emphasizes closing tax loopholes for some large corporations and providing government support for high-priority areas within the sector.\nThe agenda carries over a key part of the strategy undertaken by the Biden administration, which invested billions into manufacturing through a series of measures focused on bolstering key industries.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act spent hundreds of millions of dollars to boost U.S. production of renewables as the nation pursues ambitious carbon emissions goals and a supply chain less dependent on China. While the CHIPS and Sciences Act infused tens of billions into the production of semiconductors.\n\"The Biden administration has picked sectors, and in those sectors companies are eligible for assistance,\" said Lovely.\nLast week, Harris put forward a plan calling for $100 billion investment in manufacturing to further bolster the sector. The policy would prioritize \"industries of the future,\" such as carbon-efficient steel production and data centers for artificial intelligence, the campaign said in a statement last week.\nThe Harris campaign said it aims to pay for the investment with a reform of the international tax code that prevents producers from skirting U.S. taxes in a \"race to the bottom.\"\n\"The facts are clear: When he was president, Trump lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs and created new incentives for companies to ship American jobs to China. Economists warn if Trump takes power again, his policies will crush American manufacturing jobs, send even more jobs to China, and cost middle class families $4,000 a year. This is a fundamental contrast with Vice President Harris, who is leading an American manufacturing boom \u2013 creating jobs right here at home and outcompeting China,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Joseph Costello said in a statement to ABC News.\nIt remains unclear whether the support for manufacturing provided by the Biden administration has yielded significant gains in output or jobs, experts said.\nThe measures, however, have elicited a burst of factory construction. Spending on manufacturing-related construction surged from $76.4 billion in January 2021 to $238.2 billion in August 2024, U.S. Census Bureau data showed.\nThe surge in construction marks a positive signal but the critical test will be whether the plants deliver strong output and well-paying, long-term jobs, said Conlon.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stock-market-today-asian-shares-climb-after-blockbuster-114552440", "Title": "Stock market today: Wall Street slides after Treasury yields climb back above 4% and oil rises", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 12:43 AM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks slid Monday after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.The S&P 500 dropped 1%, though it\u2019s still close to its all-time high set a week earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398 points, or 0.9%, coming off its own record, while the Nasdaq composite sank 1.2%.\nIt\u2019s a stall for U.S. stocks after they rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation. Friday\u2019s blowout report on U.S. jobs growth  raised optimism about the economy and hopes that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing for it.\nThe stronger-than-expected hiring pushed Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle to say he now sees just a 15% chance of a recession, down from 20%. \nBut Friday\u2019s jobs report was so strong that it also forced traders to ratchet back forecasts for how much the Fed will ultimately cut interest rates by. That in turn has sent Treasury yields higher, and the 10-year yield is back above 4% for the first time since August.\nThe two-year Treasury yield also briefly climbed back above 4% Monday, up from 3.50% a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s a sizeable move for the bond market, and it can drag on prices for stocks and all kinds of other investments.\nWhen Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices  for stocks and other things that carry bigger risk of losing money.\nMonday\u2019s sharpest losses hit stocks of utility companies. These kinds of stocks tend to pay big dividends, which means they can see potential buyers leave when bonds are paying more in interest.\nUtilities fell 2.3% for the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 index, including a 5.2% drop for Vistra and a 3.3% slide for Duke Energy. \nIt\u2019s more difficult to look attractive to investors seeking income when a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.02% yield, up from 3.97% late Friday and from 3.62% three weeks ago.\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, jumped more on Monday. It rose to 3.99% from 3.92% late Friday.\nTreasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been spurting higher on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nBrent crude, the international standard, rose another 3.7% Monday to settle at $80.93 per barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, also gained 3.7%, to $77.14 per barrel.\nStocks that are seen as the most expensive can feel the most downward pressure from higher Treasury yields, and the spotlight has been on Big Tech stocks. They drove the majority of the S&P 500\u2019s returns in recent years and soared to heights that critics called overdone.\nApple fell 2.3%, Amazon dropped 3% and Alphabet sank 2.4% to act as some of Monday's heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\nAn exception was Nvidia, which rose another 2.3%. It rode another upswell in excitement about artificial-intelligence technology after Super Micro Computer soared 15.8% after saying it recently shipped more than 100,000 graphics processing units with liquid cooling.\nIf Treasury yields keep rising, companies will likely need to deliver bigger profits to drive their stock prices much higher, and this week marks the start of the latest corporate earnings reporting season.\nAnalysts say earnings per share grew 4.2% during the summer for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier, led by technology and health care companies, according to FactSet. If those analysts are correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. \nPepsiCo will report its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but the momentum will really pick up Friday. That\u2019s when JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of New York Mellon will report, as banks dominate the early days of reporting season. \nBank stocks were mixed Monday, with a few adding to gains from Friday when the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised hopes that customers will borrow more money and make good on the loans. \nElsewhere on Wall Street, winemaker Duckhorn Portfolio more than doubled after a private-equity firm said it would buy the company for roughly $1.95 billion in cash.\nAll told, the S&P fell 55.13 points to 5,695.94. The Dow dropped 398.51 to 41,954.24, and the Nasdaq sank 213.95 to 17,923.90.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes were mixed following bigger gains in Asia.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 1.8% after the value of the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. A weaker yen can boost profits for Japanese exporters.\nStock markets in mainland China will reopen on Tuesday from a weeklong holiday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. \n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/coca-cola-spiced-canceled-after-7-months-market-114077311", "Title": "Coca-Cola Spiced is getting canceled after 7 months on the market", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "September 25, 2024, 10:55 AM", "Content": "Coca-Cola Co. is discontinuing its newest \u201cpermanent\u201d flavor a little more than seven months after putting it on the market.The beverage giant said Wednesday that Coca-Cola Spiced and Coca-Cola Spiced Zero Sugar will be phased out and replaced with a new flavor that will be introduced next year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re always looking at what our consumers like and adjusting our range of products,\u201d the Atlanta-based company said in a statement.\nCoca-Cola Spiced went on sale in the U.S. and Canada on Feb. 19.

In April, he proposed a higher tariff of at least 60% on Chinese goods.\nEconomists who spoke to ABC News confirmed that tariffs are widely thought to raise prices for consumers in the importing country. That\u2019s because foreign producers typically pass along some or all of the tax burden to consumers in the form of higher prices, they said.\n\u201cThis is generally accepted in economics,\u201d said Stephan Weiler, a professor of economics at Colorado State University and a former Fed research officer.\nEconomists couldn't verify the estimate put forward by Harris of a 20% increase on the prices of goods, in part because it's difficult to predict exactly how foreign manufacturers might respond to tariffs.\nIn theory, foreign producers that control a given market could offset higher taxes by pushing the costs onto consumers with price increases, Yeva Nersisyan, a professor of economics at Franklin & Marshall College, told ABC News. However, Nersisyan added, companies in competitive industries may face more difficulty doing so.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether that 20% number is accurate,\u201d Nersisyan said.\nEconomists who spoke to ABC News rejected the assertion that the nation\u2019s bout of inflation marks its worst ever, noting that the U.S. endured higher price increases as recently as the 1980s.\nIn addition, economists said Trump overstated the extent to which the Biden administration caused the rapid rise in prices, though they acknowledged that a stimulus measure enacted by Biden may have contributed to some of the inflation.\nLike many economic problems, inflation emerged due to an imbalance between supply and demand, economists said.\nHundreds of millions of people across the globe who endured pandemic-era lockdowns replaced restaurant expenditures with online orders of couches and exercise bikes. But the demand for goods and labor far outpaced supply, as COVID-19-related bottlenecks slowed delivery times and infection fears kept production workers on the sidelines.\n\u201cThe number-one cause of the inflation was a supply adjustment to the COVID shock, particularly coming out of isolation,\u201d Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard University, told ABC News.\nPandemic-era spending measures enacted by Trump and Biden may also have contributed to the price spike, economists said.\nJason Furman, a professor at Harvard University and former economic adviser to President Barack Obama, estimated that Biden's American Rescue Plan added between 1 and 4 percentage points to the inflation rate in 2021, Roll Call reported. Michael Strain, of the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, estimated that the legislation added 3 percentage points to inflation.\n\u201cOne could argue that the COVID-related policies helped heat and possibly overheat the economy,\u201d Weiler said.\nThe economy had already emerged from the pandemic-induced recession and begun to recover by the time Biden took office, economists said.\nHowever, the U.S. remained well below pre-pandemic levels in some key measures of economic health, including employment. In turn, economists said, Biden inherited an economy in need of significant rejuvenation.\nThe unemployment rate peaked at 14.8% in April 2020 when Trump was in office \u2013 which was indeed the highest level since the Great Depression, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But unemployment rapidly declined to 6.4% in January 2021 by the time Trump left office, as the economy started to rebalance.\nThe effort to blame Trump for the spike in unemployment is misleading, since it resulted from a once-in-a-century pandemic, economists said.\n\u201cCOVID is the tidal wave that overwhelmed the whole story,\u201d Weiler said. \u201cThe politics of this is hyperbole.\u201d\nThe COVID-induced recession lasted two months in the spring of 2020, the shortest U.S. recession ever recorded, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a non-profit organization that serves as the recognized authority on economic downturns. The speedy recovery was owed in part to trillions in economic stimulus enacted by Trump that March.\n\u201cIt was very quick and very, very big,\u201d Nersisyan said.\nStill, the economy suffered a dearth of jobs and persistent supply blockages when Biden took office, economists said. Over the course of the Biden administration, the labor market expanded at a rapid pace while economic growth quickened. By 2022, the economy had recovered all of the jobs that were lost during the pandemic.\n\u201cThe recovery from the recession had already begun when Biden took office, but it hadn\u2019t gotten that far,\u201d Frankel said.\nTrump sharply criticized Harris for a perceived lack of detailed economic proposals.\nSome economists who spoke to ABC News agreed that there was an absence of a complete economic plans from Harris. However, they added, Trump has also failed to provide a detailed set of policy proposals on economic issues.\n\u201cI would like to see more detailed policy proposals from both candidates,\u201d Anne Villamil, a professor of economics at the University of Iowa, told ABC News.\n\u201cFor Harris, I would like to know how her policies would differ from current policies,\u201d Villamil added. \u201cFor Trump, I would like to know how his policies would differ from the policies of his previous administration.\u201d\nLast month, Harris unveiled economic plans intended to ease inflation, fix the housing market, and slash taxes for middle-income families. The plans include eye-catching proposals such as a $25,000 subsidy for first-time homebuyers and a ban on grocery price gouging, the latter of which had not been put forward by Biden.\nHarris has also proposed a 28% tax on long-term capital gains, which clocks in well below the 39.6% tax rate for such income put forward by Biden.\nTrump has said he would renew his signature tax-cut measure, which eased taxes for individuals and corporations, while vowing to do away with taxes on tips and Social Security benefits.\n\u201cTrump is not one who has a lot of detailed policies himself,\u201d Nersisyan said. \u201cThis is not a policy election.\u201d\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/austrian-activist-schrems-wins-privacy-case-meta-personal-114492941", "Title": "Activist wins privacy case against Meta over personal data on sexual orientation", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 4, 2024, 7:13 AM", "Content": "LONDON -- The European Union's top court said Friday that social media company Meta can't use public information about a user's sexual orientation obtained outside its platforms for personalized advertising under the bloc's strict data privacy rules.

But Black and Latina women are starting to gain ground, landing top positions at some of the biggest unions in the U.S. That has translated into wins at the bargaining table that focus more attention on family-friendly benefits like parental leave and health care coverage, as well as protections against sexual harassment. \nOften when people think about unions, \"they think of a white guy in a hard hat. But in fact, studies show that about two-thirds of working people who are covered by a union contract are women and/or people of color,\u201d said Georgetown University labor historian Lane Windham.\nIndeed, hospitality union UNITE HERE's membership is majority women and people of color. And last month, more than 12,000 of them across six states went on strike to push for wage increases, fair workloads and more affordable health care under the leadership of Gwen Mills, who in June became the first woman to be elected union president in its 130-year history. \nData from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that Black and Latina women experience a particularly wide gender pay gap. They also face intersectional headwinds of both racism and sexism in their careers, making them even more attuned to inequities in the workplace and motivating them to increasingly step up the fight as union leaders. \nBlack and Latina women are driving labor union growth in the U.S. amid a decades-long decline in membership. In 2023, Black women's union membership rate notched a slight bump from 10.3% to 10.5%, while Latinas went up from 8.5% to 8.8%. But that's still more than white men and women as well as Asian women, whose membership experienced a decrease during the same time period. \nMomentum for Black and Latina women rising into labor union leadership has picked up in the last five years. But the work began long before that by \"our foremothers who laid this foundation and have been pushing and kicking those doors open for decades,\u201d according to Liz Shuler, who in June 2022 became the first woman in history to lead the AFL-CIO, a federation of 60 national and international labor unions. \n\u201cThe #MeToo movement, I think, has really emboldened women across the board, including in labor, to say, you know what? I\u2019m not going to be sitting on the sidelines,\u201d Shuler said. The pandemic also put a spotlight on essential workers such as nurses, service workers and care workers, who are predominantly women and minorities.\nToday\u2019s examples of diverse union leaders include Becky Pringle, a Black woman who leads the National Education Association, the nation's largest union; Bonnie Castillo, the first Latina to serve as executive director of National Nurses United; and April Verrett, who in May became the first Black woman to lead the Service Employees International Union, which says about 60% of its service worker members are people of color, and two-thirds are women. \n\u201cIf we want to build power on those who are perceived to have the least amount of power, then we've got to create space for our people of those identities to be able to lead,\u201d Verrett told The Associated Press.\nBut while female-dominated fields have made strides in union leadership diversity, \u201cthere is still a long way to go\u201d for unions in male-dominated fields like building and manufacturing trades, said University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign labor historian Emily Twarog. Despite some headway through DEI and apprenticeship programs, \u201cthere hasn\u2019t been that kind of culture shift.\u201d\nMen still have a higher union membership rate than women \u2014 10.5% versus 9.5% respectively, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And workplace sexual harassment and biases still run rampant in many places, including for Chicago-based Lisa Lujano, a journey-level carpenter and member of Carpenters Union Local 13. \nThings might get better, she said, if more Black and Latina women held union leadership roles and were more aware of their memberships' needs, including safety gear that fits women\u2019s bodies, or parental leave, which Lujano does not have. \n\u201cI think we would get more respect out in the field,\u201d she said.\nHere's a look at the impact women union leaders have had at the bargaining table:\nTeachers\u2019 unions have in recent years begun to use their collective power to push for wraparound benefits to help their surrounding community in a method known as \"bargaining for the common good,\" which aims to go beyond wages and benefits at the bargaining table and tackle wider social issues. The Chicago Teachers Union, for example, included demands for affordable housing citywide during a strike in 2019 \u2014 in part organized by then-vice president Stacy Davis Gates, who is now CTU president.\nSome teachers' unions are also fighting for racial justice, including the United Teachers Los Angeles, which demanded that the school district stop subjugating students to random metal detector screenings and locker checks without cause, decrying the practice as disproportionately targeting Black and minority students.\n\u201cWe need to address the inequities that are built into every single social system in this country that determine whether our students come to school ready to learn every day,\u201d Pringle said. \u201cIt was our female leaders, particularly our leaders of color, who really leaned into that.\u201d\nUnionized hotel workers like Maria Mata have made strides toward fighting the rampant sexual harassment in their profession.\nMata, a Hispanic housekeeper and UNITE HERE union leader at the W San Francisco, helped lead a successful push at her hotel for workers to be equipped with panic buttons in 2018 to summon security help in an emergency, now implemented by several major hotel chains.\n\u201cWe needed more protection,\u201d especially during night shifts spent cleaning entire floors alone, explained Mata, who has herself twice experienced sexual harassment on the job. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous.\" \nIt\u2019s also vital for the women doing the work to also sit at the bargaining table, \u201cbecause sometimes as women, we need something that the men don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mata, whose hotel is currently in bargaining for a new contract.\nKeturah Johnson in 2022 became the first queer woman of color to serve as international vice president for flight attendant union AFA-CWA, which is led by Sara Nelson and represents over 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines.\nPeople often think of a flight attendant as \u201ca white woman with hair put up in a bun,\u201d and Black flight attendants frequently face microaggressions from managers about their appearance, Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s happened to me many times because of my natural hair.\"\nAnd for gender nonconforming flight attendants, being able to wear a uniform that reflects their gender identity is important, Johnson said. So she's leading the fight to update uniform standards to be gender inclusive and permit natural hairstyles, which has resulted in several airlines making changes.\nUnited Airlines, for instance, updated its uniform standards to include gender neutral options in 2021, and Alaska Airlines management adopted gender neutral uniform and appearance standards in 2022, according to AFA. Frontier allowed natural hairstyles for flight attendants in 2021, and this year implemented standardized pricing for all uniforms regardless of size or gender.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just there to serve Diet Coke. And so it\u2019s our job to make sure that flight attendants are represented and seen just as they are,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe world is changed now.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/airlines-capping-fares-hurricanes-path-biden-warns-price-114622015", "Title": "Airlines say they're capping fares in the hurricane's path as Biden warns against price gouging", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 5:44 PM", "Content": "A few airports in Florida began closing and airlines canceled hundreds of flights on Tuesday ahead of Hurricane Milton's arrival.

It went up to like $750 within a matter of seconds,\u201d she said. \"There were prices even as high as $1,000 for one leg. So wrong! So wrong!\u201d \nJeremy Bingaman, a music-industry podcaster, posted a screenshot of United Airlines fares for flights out of Tampa to St. Louis on Tuesday. They went as high as $2,351 for refundable tickets in economy class on United Express, compared with Southwest, which showed tickets at $399, and American, which displayed flights to Chicago for around $600.\n\u201cHey (at)united, what\u2019s up with the price gouging in Tampa for people trying to evacuate? ... shady,\u201d he wrote in an X post that was reposted more than 4,000 times.\nNone of those flights he highlighted took off \u2014 they were all scheduled after the airport suspended operations. \nUnited spokesperson Leslie Scott said the itinerary that Bingaman posted included two connections, and noted that the flight never happened.\n\u201cWe implemented fare caps on Sunday. Since then, the average price paid for a one-way, economy-class ticket to our hubs from the impacted Florida markets was below $500,\u201d Scott said.\nDelta said it capped fares, although it gave no figures.

The safety of our passengers and employees is our top priority.\u201d\nEven when the weather is good, airlines often raise prices on tickets bought hours or a few days before departure, when there are fewer unsold seats left. That can blur the line between price gouging and the airlines' regular practice of maximizing revenue from each flight.\nBiden did not give any examples of price gouging this week. A spokesperson for the U.S. Transportation Department said the agency has been in touch with airlines to get more information about the availability and affordability of flights in the storm's path.\nEarlier, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a post on X, \u201cThe Department takes all allegations of airline price-gouging seriously. We are keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton to make sure airlines are not charging excessively increasing fares.\u201d\nWilliam McGee, a travel expert and advocate for the American Economic Liberties Project, which opposes big corporations, said his group has seen the comments on social media about airlines \u2014 especially United, Delta and American \u2014 raising prices as the hurricane approached Florida. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this with growing frequency in the deregulated era in response to natural disasters and terrorist attacks,\u201d McGee said. \"It\u2019s important for consumers who are experiencing this to file complaints with the (Transportation Department) and perhaps share details on social media.\u201d\nU.S. flight cancellations were expected to soar past 1,600 on Wednesday, when Milton was forecast to come ashore along Florida's central Gulf coast. The bulk of those cancellations are in Florida. \nSt. Pete-Clearwater International Airport said it would close after the last flight Tuesday and reopen on Friday. Orlando International Airport planned to shut down Wednesday morning, and nearby Melbourne Orlando International Airport said it would stop flights Wednesday afternoon until Friday.\nTravelers struggling to get out of Florida expressed exasperation and fatigue over high prices, canceled and delayed flights, and poor customer service.\nJohn Fedor, a roofer from the Philadelphia suburbs, and his wife were trying to get home after a Caribbean cruise. They missed their flight out of Tampa. He said they got no help and were \u201ctreated so horribly\u201d by a Frontier Airlines agent, then looked into other ways home. He was quoted $675 for a rental car. They saw train fares for $125 each, but by the time they tried to purchase a pair, the train was sold out.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get home. We don\u2019t know what day we\u2019re getting home,\u201d Fedor said. \u201cThis probably has been the worst vacation of my life.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/piece-piece-pharrell-finds-lego-fits-life-story-114619802", "Title": "In 'Piece by Piece,' Pharrell finds Lego fits his life story", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:58 PM", "Content": "TORONTO -- When Pharrell Williams and Morgan Neville decided to embark on a movie about Williams\u2019 life but animated in Lego pieces, they knew there would be culture shocks. But making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d still led to some places that neither Williams, Neville or Lego could foresee.\u201cWe did have extensive conversations about how wide a back of a bikini bottom would be on a minifig in a \u2018Rump Shaker\u2019 video,\u201d says Neville, chuckling. \u201cWe had many discussions about things I thought I would never be talking about as a filmmaker.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece\u201d did not come with any easy-to-assemble instructions. It\u2019s part music biopic, part documentary, part family film. It is, like many things about Williams\u2019 hit-making life, radiant with uplift, beats and idiosyncrasy. \n\u201cSociety likes to put us in boxes, pun intended,\u201d Williams says, speaking alongside Neville. \u201cHere was a moment where this guy\u2019s view of my life and the way he saw it strung together was incredibly liberating for me. While I\u2019ve never seen myself in a box, this helps other people now to, as well.\u201d\n\u201cPiece by Piece,\u201d which Focus Features releases in theaters Friday, begins, like many documentaries, with the director, Neville, sitting down with a camera crew focused on their subject, Williams. But in this case, Williams \u2014 and everything else, including a bearded, bespectacled Neville \u2014 are Lego.\n\u201cWhat if we told my life with Legos?\u201d Williams asks in the film. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen,\u201d replies Neville.\nWhat follows is something like a traditional documentary complete with colorful recounting of past struggles and triumphs, from his upbringing in Virginia Beach to his string of chart-topping hits, told through Williams\u2019 voiceover and a number of talking heads. It was recorded that way in interviews, either on camera, Zoom or phone, and then animated into Lego form. Here, finally, is a chance to see Busta Rhymes as a Lego, along with many others, including Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg and Missy Elliott.\n\u201cThe first meeting we had was with Lego because if they had said no, there would have been no film,\u201d says Neville, the director of documentaries including \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cWon't You Be My Neighbor\u201d and \u201cSteve!\u201d \u201cTo their credit, they not only said yes, but I think understood the kind of growth it would force them into.\u201d\nFor Lego, the Danish toy company, making \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was its biggest gamble since stepping into feature films with 2014\u2019s \u201cThe Lego Movie.\u201d Neville approached the company\u2019s head of global entertainment, Jill Wilfert with a pitch for what would be Lego\u2019s first foray into a documentary not about itself. Wilfert was immediately responsive.\n\u201cThe whole idea behind Lego is its endless creativity and limitless possibility, and Pharrell really kind of embodies that,\u201d she says.\nAs proof of concept, Neville put together a 90-second video of Williams reflecting on his upbringing and the inspiration of artists like Stevie Wonder. (A vinyl of \u201cSongs in the Key of Life\u201d is another one of those things you never expected to see as a Lego.)\n\u201cI came away from that saying, \u2018This is totally going to work,\u2019\u201d Neville says. \u201cAnd everybody we showed it to got it. They were like: I want to see this movie.\u201d\nStill, Neville and Williams knew the Lego approach would mean working within PG parameters. Some things about Williams\u2019 life \u2014 like being young and famous while operating in the upper echelons of pop and hip-hop \u2014 wouldn\u2019t fit in a family-friendly movie. Williams says the movie \u201cparaphrases\u201d his life.\n\u201cThere were definitely some areas that weren\u2019t within my expectations of where we might go,\u201d Wilfert says. \u201cWe had a lot of good dialogue throughout the whole process. Morgan and Pharrell, there was mutual respect because we are a brand that people have high expectations of and expect certain things of. So we did work with them on areas that we felt did make sense and didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\nIt also pushed Lego in other ways. Williams is particularly proud that the movie led to Lego expanding its available skin tones and hair textures. Williams\u2019 Lego self \u2014 which he carried proudly to the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d \u2014 was specifically designed to match his own skin tone.\n\u201cYou name the type of human being, we fought hard for their existence and acknowledgement,\u201d says Williams. \u201cLego obliged and I think the brand is better because of it.\u201d\nOne of the movie\u2019s most clever designs is illustrating tracks that Williams crafts himself or in collaboration, like Snoop Dogg\u2019s \u201cDrop It Like It\u2019s Hot,\u201d Gwen Stefani\u2019s \u201cHollaback Girl,\u201d Nelly\u2019s \u201cHot in Herre\u201d or Pharrell\u2019s own \u201cHappy.\u201d Each is rendered as a unique little glowing set of Legos pieced together.\nOther, less happy aspects of Williams\u2019 life don\u2019t make the cut. You won\u2019t see anything about the \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d lawsuit, in which Marvin Gaye\u2019s estate sued for copyright infringement and won. Nor is there anything in the film about Williams\u2019 recent legal squabbles with his Neptunes co-founder Chad Hugo. Earlier this year, Hugo filed a trademark opposition over the duo\u2019s name, claiming Williams\u2019 \u201cfraudulently\u201d sought control of it. Representatives for Williams have disagreed, saying Williams \u201creached out on multiple occasions to share in the ownership.\u201d\n\u201cPiece By Piece,\u201d though, does include a positive portrayal of Hugo, particularly in Williams\u2019 early days in Virginia Beach, when the two began making music together.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing bittersweet. I\u2019m so grateful for my experiences. Chad is an integral part of the beginning, the genesis of my pursuit in music and being there,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI met him in the second grade in band class, and the memories that we have of making music together, I would not be sitting here if it weren\u2019t for us meeting.\u201d\nWilliams, who is Men\u2019s Creative Director for Louis Vuitton, is talented when it comes to brand management. He released his debut solo album, \u201cIn My Mind,\u201d in 2006 and long ago stepped into the spotlight, himself. But he has, by his own acknowledgement, remained a producer at heart. Not everything about \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d was easy for him.\n\u201cA lot of that was vulnerable for me,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m, like, crying two times in the story. I hadn\u2019t considered he might ask questions that would trigger emotion. I\u2019m such a produced person. I\u2019ve produced myself so much.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that Neville, as a protean documentarian used to adapting to the style and attitude of his subjects, can relate to.\n\u201cPharrell as a producer is often holding up a mirror to artists to get them to see themselves. My job is to hold up a mirror to him to get him to see himself,\u201d Neville says. \u201cI feel like, in an odd way, we have the same job.\u201d\nWhen Neville interviewed other musicians for the film, he told them that they\u2019d be animated. But he didn\u2019t say how. It was only later they found out they\u2019d be Lego minifigs.\n\u201cEveryone was so shocked and so elated,\u201d says Williams. \u201cI feel like it released the inner child in all of them. Some of them look at life that way, anyways. Other ones, even the tough guys, were like, \u2018Oh, man, this is so cool.\u2019\u201d\nCapturing Williams\u2019 life in a playful, even childlike way will surely help some younger viewers connect to his story. Becoming a world-famous multi-hyphenate might seem out of reach to most, but \u201cPiece by Piece\u201d makes it look, almost, like a snap.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/marshall-retiring-ceo-mavericks-end-2024-remain-consultant-114621140", "Title": "Marshall is retiring as the CEO of the Mavericks at the end of 2024 but will remain as a consultant", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:47 PM", "Content": "DALLAS -- Cynt Marshall is retiring as CEO of the Dallas Mavericks at the end of the year, and then she will stay on for another year as a consultant in the organization where she is credited for a comprehensive overhaul of workplace policies.Marshall, a former AT&T executive, was introduced by the Mavericks in February 2018, about a week after a Sports Illustrated report detailed years of incidents of sexual harassment and misconduct in the franchise\u2019s business office.\nWhen hired, Marshall became the first Black female CEO in NBA history.

Jim Justice.One would reduce the state personal income tax by 2%. Another would provide a tax credit to help families pay for child care. The Republican governor is expected to sign both proposals, after they passed final legislative hurdles Tuesday during a special legislative session called by Justice. \nCuts to the state personal income tax have been a priority for Justice, who is nearing the end of his second term as governor and running for the U.S. Senate. He signed a 21.25% tax cut into effect last year, and the tax is scheduled to drop by another 4% in the new year, per a trigger in the 2023 law that allows for further tax cuts if the state meets higher-than-anticipated revenue collections.\nJustice had initially been pushing the Legislature to consider cutting the tax a further 5% but amended that proposal to a more conservative 2% cut Monday. \nA 2% cut in personal income tax rates would take effect on the first day of the new year and return approximately $46 million to taxpayers. Del. Vernon Criss, the House Finance Committee chair, said he would have preferred a 5% tax cut, but an agreement couldn't be made with the Senate to support that. \n\"I still think we are moving in the right direction,\" he said. \"That\u2019s what we all want.\"\nThe money to pay for the tax cut is coming from an expiring revenue bond and $27 million in savings the Justice administration said came from dissolving the former Department of Health and Human Resources into three new state agencies earlier this year. \nSeveral Democrats spoke against the proposal, expressing concern that the Justice administration had not provided details about where the savings were coming from and how the cut could effect state programs. West Virginia has the highest per capita rate of children in foster care in the nation. \nDemocrat Del. Kayla Young said she\u2019s never voted against a tax cut proposal during her time in the legislature, but the source of funding for this cut concerned her.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable not knowing where this money is coming from,\u201d she said. \nHouse Minority Leader Sean Hornbuckle said the tax cut won't make a meaningful impact on most working-class West Virginians' budgets \u2014 40 cents a week, or just under $21 a year. He said the trigger system included in the 2023 income tax bill is a more responsible approach, and questioned why the governor was pushing a further tax cut \u201coutside the scope of that in the 25th hour before the election.\u201d\n\u201cThe policy of it is it\u2019s taking money away from children,\u201d he said. \"And if we\u2019re going to do a tax cut, I would submit to this body that we \u2014 all of us \u2014 do a little bit more work and make sure that money is not going to affect children.\u201d \nRepublican Del. Larry Kump of Berkeley County said he disagreed that a 2% cut wouldn't be meaningful to families. He said he both grew up and lives in a working poor neighborhood, and has neighbors that have to make decisions between food and heat. \n\u201cEven a little bit is meaningful. A gallon of milk helps with a family,\u201d he said. \"Anything we can do to reduce the tax burden on our taxpayers is a good thing.\"\nA child and dependent tax credit passed by the state Legislature would allow people to receive a non-refundable credit of around $225 to apply to their taxes if they receive the federal child care tax credit, which is around $450 a year. Around 16,000 West Virginia families receive the federal child care tax credit.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/musks-reinstated-brazil-after-complying-supreme-court-demands-114618439", "Title": "Musk's X to be reinstated in Brazil after complying with Supreme Court demands", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:32 PM", "Content": "SAO PAULO -- The Brazilian Supreme Court's Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday authorized the restoration of social media platform X\u00b4s service in Brazil, over a month after its nationwide shutdown, according to a court document that was made public.Elon Musk\u2019s X was blocked on Aug. 30 in the highly online country of 213 million people \u2014 and one of X\u2019s biggest markets, with estimates of its user base ranging from 20 to 40 million. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after a monthslong dispute with Musk over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. Musk had disparaged de Moraes, calling him an authoritarian and a censor, even though his rulings, including X\u2019s suspension, were repeatedly upheld by his peers.\nDespite Musk's public bravado, X ultimately complied with all of de Moraes' demands. They included blocking certain accounts from the platform, paying outstanding fines and naming a legal representative in the country. Failure to do the latter had triggered the suspension.\n\u201cThe resumption of (X)\u2019s activities on national territory was conditioned, solely, on full compliance with Brazilian laws and absolute observance of the Judiciary's decisions, out of respect for national sovereignty,\u201d de Moraes said in the court document.\n\u201cX is proud to return to Brazil,\u201d the company said in a statement posted on its Global Government Affairs account. \"Giving tens of millions of Brazilians access to our indispensable platform was paramount throughout this entire process. We will continue to defend freedom of speech, within the boundaries of the law, everywhere we operate.\u201d\nJust two days before the ban, on Aug. 28, X said it was removing all its remaining staff in Brazil \u201ceffective immediately,\u201d saying de Moraes had threatened with arrest its legal representative in the country, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. \nBrazilian law requires foreign companies to have a local legal representative to receive notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action \u2014 particularly, in X\u2019s case, the takedown of accounts. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o was first named X\u2019s legal representative in April and resigned four months later. The company named her to the same job on Sep. 20, according to the public filing with the Sao Paulo commercial registry.\nIn an apparent effort to shield Concei\u00e7\u00e3o from potential violations by X \u2014 and risking arrest \u2014 a clause has been written into Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019s new representation agreement that she must follow Brazilian law and court decisions, and that any legal responsibility she assumes on X\u2019s behalf requires prior instruction from the company in writing, according to the company\u2019s filing.\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o works for BR4Business, a business services firm. Its two-page website provides no insight into its operations or staff. \u201cSomething great is on its way,\u201d the top of the site\u2019s main page reads in English. Its other page is an extensive privacy policy. \nAt three of its listed Sao Paulo offices, receptionists told the AP that the company\u2019s offices are empty and employees work remotely. Neither Concei\u00e7\u00e3o nor BR4Business returned multiple phone calls and emails from the AP.\nThere is nothing illegal or suspect about using a company like BR4Business for legal representation, but it shows that X is doing the bare minimum to operate in the country, said Fabio de Sa e Silva, a lawyer and associate professor of International and Brazilian Studies at the University of Oklahoma.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t demonstrate an intention to truly engage with the country. Take Meta, for example, and Google. They have an office, a government relations department, precisely to interact with public authorities and discuss Brazil\u2019s regulatory policies concerning their businesses,\u201d Silva added.\nIndeed, it is rare for an established, influential company such as X to have only a legal representative, said Carlos Affonso Souza, a lawyer and director of the Institute for Technology and Society, a Rio-based think tank. And that could be problematic going forward.\n\u201cThe concern now is what comes next and how X, once back in operation, will manage to meet the demands of the market and local authorities without creating new tensions,\u201d he said.\nSome of Brazilian X\u2019s users have migrated to other platforms, such as Meta\u2019s Threads and, primarily, Bluesky. It\u2019s unclear how many of them will return to X. In a statement to the AP, Bluesky reported that it now has 10.6 million users and continues to see strong growth in Brazil. Bluesky has appointed a legal representative in the South American country.\nBrazil was not the first country to ban X \u2014 far from it \u2014 but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest.\nX\u2019s dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company\u2019s dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta\u2019s Facebook and WhatsApp), for not complying with the government\u2019s requests to take down posts related to farmers\u2019 protests that rocked the country.\nMusk\u2019s decision to reverse course in Brazil after publicly criticizing de Moraes isn\u2019t surprising, said Matteo Ceurvels, research firm Emarketer\u2019s analyst for Latin America and Spain.\n\u201cThe move was pragmatic, likely driven by the economic consequences of losing access to millions of users in its third-largest market worldwide, along with the millions of dollars in associated advertising revenue,\u201d Ceurvels said. \u201cAlthough X may not be a top priority for most advertisers in Brazil, the platform needs them more than they need it.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/colombian-electoral-authorities-open-investigation-president-petros-2022-114618145", "Title": "Colombian electoral authorities open investigation against President Petro's 2022 campaign", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:22 PM", "Content": "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Electoral authorities in Colombia on Tuesday ruled in favor of investigating financial misconduct allegations against the 2022 campaign that got President Gustavo Petro elected.The investigation to be carried out by the National Electoral Council will focus on whether the campaign exceeded financing limits and whether it accepted funds from prohibited sources. The electoral body previously delayed deciding on the inquiry, which some, including Petro, see as politically motivated and illegal.\nThe outcome of the investigation could result in fines against some campaign staffers, including its auditors, treasurer and manager. It can't lead to an immediate impeachment of the president.\nThe council\u2019s decision came after two of its 10 magistrates presented a report alleging that Petro\u2019s presidential campaign exceeded financial limits by about $1.2 million. Petro has denied the accusations, which he has said are an initial effort by his adversaries to remove him from office.\nPetro responded to the council's decision with a brief message on X: \u201cThe coup d\u2019\u00e9tat has begun,\u201d he wrote.

The statement also alleged that Petro\u2019s campaign received funds from \u201cprohibited sources of financing,\u201d including labor organizations.\nThe possibility of an investigation against the president generated a political and legal debate about the council\u2019s powers and presidential immunity.\nIn Colombia, only a commission of the House of Representatives can investigate the president. But the country's Council of State last month ruled that the president\u2019s immunity doesn't prevent him from being investigated by another government body such as the National Electoral Council, which can only impose financial penalties. The Council of State maintained that only Congress can impeach the president.\nNo president in Colombia has been removed from office in a political trial in Congress in the last 30 years.\nPetro\u2019s attorney, Hector Carvajal, last month told a radio station that he had already filed an appeal with the Council of State to reconsider its decision and clarify that the president\u2019s immunity is comprehensive, so he couldn't be investigated by electoral authorities. Carvajal warned that should electoral authorities open the investigation, he would file an appeal with Colombia's Constitutional Court and would also resort to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.\n____\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/major-us-stock-indexes-fared-tuesday-1082024-114617521", "Title": "How major US stock indexes fared Tuesday, 10/8/2024", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:20 PM", "Content": "U.S. stocks rebounded as falling oil prices release some of the pressure that built up on the market.The S&P 500 rose 1% Tuesday and clawed back its loss from the day before.

The company does not admit to any liability in the settlement, which the EPA said is the largest amount ever sought for a refinery under a Clean Air Act rule that requires owners and operators to ensure that regulated and other extremely hazardous substances are managed safely.\nThe EPA found that the company failed to identify and assess hazards posed by a pipe elbow in a hydrofluoric acid alkylation unit at the refinery in Philadelphia.

At the time, it was the largest oil refining complex on the East Coast, processing 335,000 barrels of crude oil daily.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mlb-air-local-games-guardians-brewers-twins-beginning-114617289", "Title": "MLB will air local games for Guardians, Brewers and Twins next season", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:51 PM", "Content": "Major League Baseball announced Tuesday it will produce and distribute local broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians, Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins next year. All three teams had contracts with Diamond Sports Group that expired at the end of the regular season.The Texas Rangers, whose deal also expired last month, also announced they will no longer be partnering with Diamond. They are assessing their options for next season.\nThe addition of the Guardians, Brewers and Twins means MLB will be handling the production and distribution of at least six teams going into 2025.\nMLB took over broadcasts of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks during the 2023 season and the Colorado Rockies this year.\nRick Schlesinger, the president of business operations for the Brewers, said he expects more teams could be partnering with MLB by the opening of next season.\n\u201cThis has been a long process. It\u2019s a very deliberative process,\" he said. \"We\u2019ve done this through a lot of work, a lot of analysis. I think this is going to be a huge game changer for us, for our content.\u201d\nBy taking over the broadcasts, MLB expects to increase the market reach of its teams by at least 2 million households in each market. The Diamondbacks went from being available in 930,000 households on a regional sports network to 5.6 million homes through a combination of being on local cable systems, satellite and direct-to-consumer streaming.\n\u201cWith the media landscape continuing to evolve, Major League Baseball is committed to serving our fans by ensuring they can see their favorite clubs, removing blackouts where we can, and ultimately growing the reach of our games,\u201d Noah Garden, MLB deputy commissioner for business and media, said in a statement.\nThe Twins took a public relations hit in Minnesota for cutting their 2024 player payroll coming off a division title and their first postseason series win in 22 years, in light of the reduced rights fee coming from Diamond. They will lose the rights fee altogether with this MLB-produced model, but team president Dave St. Peter said this announcement would not have an effect on player spending for the upcoming season.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a tremendous amount of time with Major League Baseball trying to better understand this marketplace, trying to better understand what a model like this will ultimately provide to the team. We also have studied closely what\u2019s happened in San Diego, in Arizona and in Colorado. We\u2019ve gotten comfortable in those economics. They are where they are,\" St. Peter said.\n\"We do expect that there will be a reduction in local revenue coming to the Twins in 2025. I think that\u2019s a fact. That said, over the long haul we have tremendous confidence in our content and believe, while maybe we\u2019ll take a dip for \u201925, that over time the viewership and those economics related to that viewership will increase.\u201d\nCleveland games were available on approximately 1.45 million households on its regional sports network. That reach is expected to increase 235% to 4.86 million households. Minnesota's will go up 307% from 1.08 million homes to 4.4 million.\nSchlesinger said the Brewers had 800,000 households that could receive games this past season, but he also expects to see significant growth with the new model.\n\u201cFrom a fan perspective, it\u2019s great because you\u2019re going to have total access and no blackouts,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of staffing, a lot of infrastructure, a lot of decisions have to be made, a lot of people to be hired, a lot of sponsors to contact. This is the right time to do this. It\u2019s a good jumping point, platform to make sure when the calendar turns to 2025, we\u2019re already fully immersed in this and that we know when the first game starts, that we\u2019re ready to go and the product\u2019s going to be outstanding.\u201d\nMLB could be taking over more teams as Diamond Sports Group continues to go through bankruptcy proceedings. The nation's largest owner of regional sports networks could be down to doing only Atlanta Braves games in 2025.\nThe operator of the Bally Sports regional networks presented its reorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston last week. As part of the reorganization, Diamond plans to void the contracts of the Detroit Tigers and Tampa Bay Rays and to attempt to rework the deals of the five franchises that are partial owners of their regional sports networks \u2014 the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Los Angeles Angels, Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals.\nSt. Peter said he expects more teams to sign onto the model in the future.\n\u201cStarting to build that direct-to-consumer foundation, which clearly is the future of the way our games will be distributed \u2014 it\u2019s time to get on with that and we\u2019re excited about that,\u201d St. Peters said. \u201cOur ownership understands the consequences of that, but I think over time there\u2019s way more upside than short-term downside.\u201d\nA final hearing on Diamond's reorganization plan is scheduled for Nov. 14. Diamond also has the rights to 13 NBA and eight NHL teams.\nDiamond Sports Group and Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the regional sports networks from The Walt Disney Co. for nearly $10 billion in 2019.

The investigative nonprofit Housing Rights Initiative announced Tuesday that it has filed complaints with the California Civil Rights Department, alleging landlords violated a state law against denying leases to renters who pay with vouchers. It seeks penalties against 203 companies and individuals. \nThe nonprofit is also pushing for more state funding to adequately enforce the law, which Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2019. \n\u201cThis historic filing serves as an opportunity for the Governor and his housing enforcement agency to enforce the very bill he signed into law and hold violators accountable,\u201d the Housing Rights Initiative said in a statement. \nNewsom's office referred comment on the filing to the state Civil Rights Department. Rishi Khalsa, a department spokesperson, said the agency is \u201cdeeply committed to using the tools at its disposal to combat discrimination in housing.\u201d The department has reached more than 200 settlements related to similar discrimination in recent years, Khalsa said. \n\u201cWe always welcome additional support to strengthen enforcement of civil rights and we continue to work with a range of partners in those efforts,\u201d he said in an email Tuesday. \nThe goal of the Section 8 program, named for a component of the federal Housing Act, is to keep rental properties affordable and prevent homelessness, which has reached crisis levels in California. Under the program, which has a long waiting list, tenants typically pay about 30% of their income on rent, with the voucher covering the rest.\nOver the course of a year, undercover investigators posing as prospective tenants reached out via text messages to landlords, property managers and real estate agents to determine compliance with California's fair housing laws. The investigation found voucher holders were explicitly discriminated against 44% of the time in San Francisco. Voucher denials took place in 53% of cases in Oakland, 58% in San Jose, and 70% in Los Angeles.\nIn one text message exchange, an agent with EXP Realty, a national brokerage firm, tells an investigator posing as a prospective tenant that utilities are included in the monthly rate for a rental unit. When informed that the tenant has a Section 8 voucher, the agent responds, \u201cI don't work with that program,\" according to the investigation. \nIn another exchange, a broker with Sotheby\u2019s International Realty replies to an investigator posing as a hopeful renter, \u201cOh sorry, owner not accepting Section 8.\u201d\nRepresentatives for EXP and Sotheby's didn't immediately respond Tuesday to emails seeking comment on the claims. \nKate Liggett, program director of Housing Rights Initiative, estimates the filing represents just a fraction of discrimination against Section 8 tenants in California. \n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/miltons-storm-surge-threat-devastating-tampa-bay-region-114611884", "Title": "Milton's storm surge is a threat that could be devastating far beyond the Tampa Bay region", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 2:52 PM", "Content": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Two weeks ago, Hurricane Helene \u201cspared\u201d the Tampa Bay region a direct hit and yet storm surge still caused catastrophic damage, flooding homes, drowning people who decided to stay near the coast and leaving massive piles of debris that still sit along roadsides.Now that Hurricane Milton, a more powerful storm, is heading straight for the same region, what can residents expect?\n\u201cWorse. Much worse,\u201d said former Federal Emergency Management Director Craig Fugate, a Florida resident who previously ran the state's emergency management division. \nThe cities near the mouth of Tampa Bay saw some of the worst storm surge in memory during Helene even though the storm landed more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) to the north. Now forecasters say the low-lying region could be hit with 15 feet (5 meters) of storm surge.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t water that rises slowly. This is fast-moving water with waves. It\u2019s like a battering ram,\" Fugate said. \"You just don\u2019t want to be in that area. That\u2019s how we lost a lot of lives in all those surge areas where people didn\u2019t get out. They either drowned or were crushed by their houses collapsing on them.\u201d\nStorm surge is the level at which sea water rises above its normal level.\nMuch like the way a storm\u2019s sustained winds do not include the potential for even stronger gusts, storm surge doesn\u2019t include the wave height above the mean water level of the surge itself.\nSurge is also the amount above what the normal tide is at the time, so a 15-foot (5-meter) storm surge at high tide with 10-foot (3-meter) waves on top of that can level buildings with ease, knock down bridges and flatten anything in its path.\nFlorida's west peninsular coast contains the Tampa Bay region, though it's not just the city of Tampa that's at risk. St. Petersburg and densely populated barrier islands are on the Gulf of Mexico near the mouth of the bay. And the threat from storm surge extends about 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the north into the state's Big Bend region and more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) to the south to Naples and into the Florida Keys.\nMilton will have an enormous impact no matter where it lands, but the worst surge will be to the south of Milton's eye. If that includes Tampa Bay and the 3.3 million people who live in the region, flooding could be catastrophic. The region hasn't had a direct hit from a major hurricane in more than 100 years.\nIf it hits to the south of Tampa Bay, cities like Sarasota, Venice, Fort Myers and Naples could be devastated just two years after Hurricane Ian caused catastrophic damage, washed away homes and businesses and made bridges to barrier islands impassable.\nState and local governments are moving as quickly as they can to remove storm tree limbs, furniture, appliances and other debris left in huge piles after Helene. But they won't get rid of all of it.\nWhile state and local officials fear Milton's wind and surge can turn debris into deadly projectiles, Fugate points out that it won't kill anybody if they evacuate and that property damage will be severe with or without debris blowing and washing around.\n\u201cI have the feeling everything that\u2019s still standing will become debris and you won\u2019t be able to distinguish it,\u201d Fugate said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got enough water to move that stuff around, it\u2019s going to be moving houses, cars and other things as well.\u201d\nSure, Milton could weaken from a Category 5 to a Category 3 before landfall, but that won't make a big difference when it comes to storm surge.\n\u201cWind doesn\u2019t have memory, storm surge does. So, what a storm is doing a day out will have a lot of impact on storm surge,\u201d Fugate said. \u201cOnce that energy is in the water and your pushing it, even if you saw some weakening, it doesn\u2019t really change.\u201d\nAnd the area where Milton's heading has a large number of creeks, canals and rivers that will could cause problems beyond the immediate coast.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mcdonalds-sues-top-meat-packers-allegedly-colluding-inflate-114611453", "Title": "McDonald's sues top meat packers for allegedly colluding to inflate the price of beef", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 2:44 PM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- McDonald\u2019s has some beef with today\u2019s largest meat packers.The fast food giant is suing the U.S. meat industry's \u201cBig Four\u201d \u2014 Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef Packing Company \u2014 and their subsidiaries, alleging a price fixing scheme for beef specifically. In a federal complaint, filed Friday in New York, McDonald's accused the companies of anticompetitive measures such as collectively limiting supply to boost prices and charge \u201cillegally inflated\u201d amounts.\nThis collusion caused the beef market to become \u201ca monopoly in which direct purchasers were forced to buy at prices dictated by (the meat packers),\u201d McDonald's suit reads \u2014 later noting that the injury it has sustained as one of those buyers is what \u201cantitrust laws were designed to prevent.\u201d\nMcDonald's alleges that the meat packers' conspiracy dates back nearly a decade, at least as early as January 2015, and continues today. Its suit argues these companies' actions violate the Sherman Act, a federal antitrust law.\nTyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. But these companies have faced federal probes and allegations of price fixing before.\nLawsuits filed by grocery stores, ranchers, restaurants and wholesalers have piled up over the years. Some litigation is still pending, although meat packers and processers have opened their wallets in the past.\nIn 2022, for example, JBS agreed to a $52.5 million settlement in a similar beef price-fixing lawsuit. And Tyson agreed to pay $221.5 million back in 2021, after facing class-action claims that alleged purposely inflated chicken prices.\nSuch settlements did not include admissions of wrongdoing, however. Meat processors have previously maintained that larger supply and demand factors out of their control, not anticompetitive behavior, has caused prices to go up. Meat processing plants were occassionally closed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, and the industry has also faced labor shortages that were worsened by the pandemic.\nStill, lawsuits like the one from McDonald's point to increased profit margins during the alleged time of conspiracy \u2014 and argue that overall concentration of the market helps facilitate collusion.\n\u201cConspiracies are easier to organize and sustain when only a few firms control a large share of the market,\u201d McDonald's suit reads.

It's not clear how much of the settlement fund will be used up by those payments because the attorneys haven't provided those details. A federal judge approved the settlement last month.\nThe lawyers haven't provided any breakdown of how many of the roughly 55,000 claims they received are for injuries and how many are for property damage, nor have they said how much each person will receive. Only 370 households and 47 businesses opted out of the deal.\nResidents who lived within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the train crash that happened near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border in February 2023 were eligible to receive up to $25,000 apiece as long as they gave up the right to sue later if someone develops cancer or any other serious health condition.\nThe property damage portion of the settlement provides larger payments of up to $70,000 per household for those living within two miles (3.2 kilometers) of the derailment, with payments decreasing the further away people lived, up to 20 miles (32 kilometers) out.\nAbout the only payment that is relatively certain is the $162 million in legal fees the judge approved as part of the settlement. That won't change unless the deal is overturned on appeal.\nResidents don't really know exactly how much they will receive. Their claims are still being reviewed, and any settlement they get will be reduced by the amount of aid they accepted after the derailment when Norfolk Southern paid to relocate families and compensate some people for lost wages and damaged belongings. Plus, some lawyers who aren't representing the overall class are still demanding to collect a percentage of any settlement some residents receive.\nAt least $18 million has been consumed by administrative expenses, though the class lawyers now say that total will grow by at least $825,000 because the claims administrator will have to handle the personal injury payments separately from the property payments.\nThe initial appeal notice filed by the Rev. Joseph Sheely in the case was divisive in East Palestine, with some residents upset that their settlement checks will be delayed making threats. Then Sheely came forward publicly and said in interviews that he wanted no part in the appeal even though he was one of the small group of residents who questioned the deal this summer, casting doubt about the future of the appeal. \nOn Tuesday, four other area residents came forward and put their names on a notice saying they intend to appeal. They might face also complaints from their neighbors that they are just being greedy, but their lawyer, David Graham, said they are willing to take the heat to help ensure the deal is fair and addresses the town's needs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got good people who have stepped forward in the face of adversity and persecution that they know they\u2019re going to likely receive. And they stepped up to file this appeal,\" Graham said.\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers filed a motion Monday asking the judge to order Sheely to post an $850,000 bond before his appeal could move forward. That may be moot now that the notice of additional appeals has been filed, but it's not clear whether the lawyers will ask all of the appellants to post a bond.\nThose who object to the deal say they felt rushed to accept it without ever receiving a full accounting of the contamination they were exposed to when tank cars full of hazardous chemicals spilled their contents or when officials decided to needlessly blow open five tank cars of vinyl chloride and burn that plastic ingredient. Some doubt the Environmental Protection Agency's assurances that their town is safe, and the plaintiffs' attorneys never disclosed what their own expert discovered when he tested for dioxins and other dangerous chemicals around East Palestine.\nThe plaintiffs' lawyers reiterated in their motion Monday that even if residents feel like they have inadequate information about the dangers they face because of questions about the EPA response or the testing data the agency reports or the cleanup, they should be able to trust the lawyers because of the research they did and the experts they consulted.\nGraham said that the personal injury payment in particular seems woefully inadequate. He said residents will quickly rack up medical bills bigger than that payment if they develop any kind of serious health problems.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hunt-gasoline-adding-floridians-anxiety-milton-nears-114609527", "Title": "The hunt for gasoline is adding to Floridians\u2019 anxiety as Milton nears", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 2:02 PM", "Content": "TAMPA, Fla. -- Florida gas stations struggled to keep up with demand Tuesday as long lines and empty pumps compounded the stress for residents planning to hunker down or flee as Hurricane Milton approached the state's western coast.

Successful testing of the vehicles' ability to master a variety of traffic situations, Liu suggested, would strengthen the public's confidence in them.\nLiu said significant research is still needed before autonomous vehicles could be rolled out safely nationwide. But he said he agreed with their manufacturers that in the long run, self-driving vehicles could potentially save lives and improve the efficiency of the nation's transportation system.\nAt present, no specific federal regulations cover self-driving vehicles, and only a few states have their own such requirements. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation, has been gathering data about crashes involving autonomous vehicles. But it has so far issued only voluntary guidelines that don't include driving tests.\nMessages were left Tuesday seeking comment from the Transportation Department.\nSelf-driving cars still must meet federal safety standards that apply to all passenger vehicles, which means the government investigates them only after serious incidents.\n\u201cOur current safety regulation for vehicles is reactive, so we depend upon self-regulation,\u201d Liu said.\nAt the University of Michigan testing center, Liu runs a mock town, called Mcity, containing a traffic light and a roundabout that is used by companies and the government to test self-driving vehicles.\nA regulation, or perhaps a voluntary test, is needed because \u201cwe don't want to create a public hazard,\u201d said Liu, who made his remarks Tuesday and announced that Mcity can now be used by researchers remotely.\nLiu suggested that a driver's test should be able to determine whether a self-driving vehicle can make a left turn at an intersection without the protection of a traffic light with a green arrow. He said it should also ensure that the vehicle will halt at a stop sign and detect and yield to a small pedestrian crossing a road. \nA test, he said, would prevent a poorly performing robot vehicle from being turned loose on society, much as a human driver's test would keep an incompetent driver off the road. But he acknowledged that no test could prevent all crashes involving self-driving vehicles.\nThe driver's tests, Liu said, would help robot vehicle developers \u201cso that when they are moving in to deploy into the U.S., into certain cities, they will face less resistance from the cities.\"\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has long complained that federal regulation is impeding innovation. Tesla is developing a robotaxi system called \u201cFull Self-Driving,\" but the robotaxis cannot drive themselves, and Tesla owners who use them must be ready to intervene at any time. \nLiu said basic driving standards would actually contribute to innovation and enhance the deployment of autonomous vehicles. If companies are confident enough for large-scale deployment of their systems, he said, a basic competency test should be \u201csmall cake,\u201d for them to pass.\n\u201cSo why could this be a hindrance for the deployment?\u201d he asked.\nEurope and China, Liu noted, already have basic tests that put autonomous vehicles through third-party testing. But the U.S. has continued to rely on self-certification by the companies.\nLiu said he is acting now to propose the driver's test because autonomous vehicles are making progress in using \u201cmachine learning\u201d computers to make decisions on the road. He predicts that they will be widely deployed on U.S. roads in five to 10 years. \n\u201cLarge-scale deployment is on the horizon, and that's why the federal government should take action,\u201d Liu said.\nAlready, Waymo, the autonomous vehicle unit of Alphabet Inc., is carrying passengers in vehicles without human safety drivers in Phoenix and other areas. General Motors' Cruise self-driving unit had been running robotaxis in San Francisco until a crash last year involving one of its vehicles.\nAlso, Aurora Innovation said it will start hauling freight in fully autonomous semis on Texas freeways by year's end. Another autonomous semi company, Gatik, plans to haul freight autonomously by the end of 2025. \n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/nhtsa-investigating-enel-juicebox-residential-electric-vehicle-chargers-114604252", "Title": "NHTSA investigating some Enel X Way JuiceBox residential electric vehicle chargers", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 12:22 PM", "Content": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating complaints about some JuiceBox residential electric vehicle chargers after reports of fires and other electrical malfunctions as the manufacturer exits the market.

The celebration will include a fireworks display and drone show.\nIt will be the first implosion in nearly a decade for a city that loves fresh starts and that has made casino implosions as much a part of its identity as gambling itself.\n\u201cWhat Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they\u2019ve turned many of these implosions into spectacles,\u201d said Geoff Schumacher, historian and vice president of exhibits and programs at the Mob Museum. \nFormer casino mogul Steve Wynn changed the way Las Vegas blows up casinos in 1993 with the implosion of the Dunes to make room for the Bellagio. Wynn thought not only to televise the event but created a fantastical story for the implosion that made it look like pirate ships at his other casino across the street were firing at the Dunes.\nFrom then on, Schumacher said, there was a sense in Las Vegas that destruction at that magnitude was worth witnessing.\nThe city hasn't blown up a Strip casino since 2016, when the final tower of the Riviera was leveled for a convention center expansion.\nThis time, the implosion will clear land for a $1.5 billion baseball stadium for the relocating Oakland Athletics, part of the city's latest rebrand into a sports hub. \nThat will leave only the Flamingo from the city\u2019s mob era on the Strip. But, Schumacher said, the Flamingo's original structures are long gone. The casino was completely rebuilt in the 1990s.\nThe Tropicana, the third-oldest casino on the Strip, closed in April after welcoming guests for 67 years.\nOnce known as the \u201cTiffany of the Strip\u201d for its opulence, it was a frequent haunt of the legendary Rat Pack, while its past under the mob has long cemented its place in Las Vegas lore.\nIt opened in 1957 with three stories and 300 hotel rooms split into two wings.\nAs Las Vegas rapidly evolved in the following decades, including a building boom of Strip megaresorts in the 1990s, the Tropicana also underwent major changes. Two hotel towers were added in later years. In 1979, the casino\u2019s beloved $1 million green-and-amber stained glass ceiling was installed above the casino floor.\nThe Tropicana's original low-rise hotel wings survived the many renovations, however, making it the last true mob structure on the Strip.\nBehind the scenes of the casino\u2019s grand opening, the Tropicana had ties to organized crime, largely through reputed mobster Frank Costello.\nCostello was shot in the head in New York weeks after the Tropicana\u2019s debut. He survived, but the investigation led police to a piece of paper in his coat pocket with the Tropicana's exact earnings figure, revealing the mob's stake in the casino.\nBy the 1970s, federal authorities investigating mobsters in Kansas City charged more than a dozen operatives with conspiring to skim $2 million in gambling revenue from Las Vegas casinos, including the Tropicana. Charges connected to the Tropicana alone resulted in five convictions.\nIts implosion on Wednesday will be streamed live and televised by local news stations.\nThere will be no public viewing areas for the event, but fans of the Tropicana did have a chance in April to bid farewell to the vintage Vegas relic.\n\u201cOld Vegas, it\u2019s going,\u201d Joe Zappulla, a teary-eyed New Jersey resident, said at the time as he exited the casino, shortly before the locks went on the doors.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hungarys-orbn-interrupted-activist-eu-presidency-news-conference-114601065", "Title": "Hungary\u2019s Orb\u00e1n interrupted by activist during EU presidency news conference", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 11:13 AM", "Content": "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- An activist and municipal councilor for a Hungarian opposition party disrupted a news conference in the French city of Strasbourg on Tuesday, as Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n was laying out his plans for Hungary's six-month presidency of the European Union.

All of the complaints were filed in state courts. \nAt the heart of each lawsuit is the TikTok algorithm, which powers what users see on the platform by populating the app\u2019s main \u201cFor You\u201d feed with content tailored to people\u2019s interests. The lawsuits note TikTok design features that they say addict children to the platform, such as the ability to scroll endlessly through content, push notifications that come with built-in \u201cbuzzes\u201d and face filters that create unattainable appearances for users. \n\u201cThey\u2019ve chosen profit over the health and safety, well-being and future of our children,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference in San Francisco. \"And that is not something we can accept. So we\u2019ve sued.\u201d\nThe latest lawsuits come nearly a year after dozens of states sued Instagram parent Meta Platforms Inc. in state and federal courts for harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms. \nKeeping people on the platform is \u201chow they generate massive ad revenue,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in an interview. \u201cBut unfortunately, that\u2019s also how they generate adverse mental health impacts on the users.\u201d\nThe legal challenges, which also include Google's YouTube, are part of a growing reckoning against social media companies and their effects on young people's lives. In some cases, the challenges have been coordinated in a way that resembles how states previously organized against the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries. \nTikTok, though, is facing an even bigger obstacle, as its very existence in the U.S. is in question. Under a federal law that took effect earlier this year, TikTok could be banned from the U.S. by mid-January if its China-based parent company, ByteDance, doesn\u2019t sell the platform by then. Both TikTok and ByteDance are challenging the law at an appeals court in Washington. A panel of three judges heard oral arguments in the case last month and are expected to issue a ruling, which could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nIn its filings Tuesday, the District of Columbia called the algorithm \u201cdopamine-inducing,\u201d and said it was created to be intentionally addictive so the company could trap many young users into excessive use and keep them on its app for hours on end. TikTok does this despite knowing that these behaviors will lead to profound psychological and physiological harms, such as anxiety, depression, body dysmorphia and other long-lasting problems, the district said.\nTikTok is disappointed that the lawsuits were filed after the company had been working with the attorneys general for two years on addressing to the issues, a spokesman said.\n\u201cWe strongly disagree with these claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading,\" the TikTok spokesman. Alex Haurek, said. \"We\u2019re proud of and remain deeply committed to the work we\u2019ve done to protect teens and we will continue to update and improve our product.\u201d\nThe social media company does not allow children under 13 to sign up for its main service and restricts some content for everyone under 18. But Washington and several other states said in their filings that children can easily bypass those restrictions, allowing them to access the service adults use despite the company's claims that its platform is safe for children. \nThe District of Columbia alleges TikTok is operating as an \u201cunlicensed virtual economy\" by allowing people to purchase TikTok Coins \u2013 a virtual currency within the platform \u2013 and send \u201cGifts\u201d to streamers on TikTok LIVE who can cash it out for real money. TikTok takes a 50% commission on these financial transactions but hasn\u2019t registered as a money transmitter with the U.S. Treasury Department or authorities in the district, according to the complaint.\nOfficials say teens are frequently exploited for sexually explicit content through TikTok\u2019s LIVE streaming feature, which has allowed the app to operate essentially as a \u201cvirtual strip club\" without any age restrictions. They say the cut the company gets from the financial transactions allows it to profit from exploitation. \nThe 14 attorneys general say the goal of their lawsuits is to stop TikTok from using these features, impose financial penalties for their alleged illegal practices and collect damages for users that have been harmed.\nThe use of social media among teens is nearly universal in the U.S. and many other parts of the world. Almost all teens ages 13 to 17 in the U.S. report using a social media platform, with about a third saying they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to the Pew Research Center.\nHigh school students who frequently use social media more commonly have persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, according to a new survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted last year in which about 20,000 teenagers participated.\nLast week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued TikTok, alleging the company was sharing and selling minors' personal information in violation of a new state law that prohibits these practices. TikTok, which disputes the allegations, is also fighting against a similar data-oriented federal lawsuit filed in August by the Department of Justice. \nSeveral Republican-led states, including Nebraska, Kansas, New Hampshire, Kansas, Iowa and Arkansas, also previously sued the company, some unsuccessfully, over allegations it is harming children's mental health, exposing them to \u201cinappropriate\u201d content or allowing young people to be sexually exploited on its platform. \n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dozen-states-sue-tiktok-claiming-platform-addictive-harms-114596399", "Title": "More than a dozen states sue TikTok, claiming its platform is addictive and harms the mental health of children", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 10:05 AM", "Content": "Video\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pepsico-lowers-revenue-forecast-weakening-demand-us-114588847", "Title": "PepsiCo lowers revenue forecast on \"subdued\" sales in US, China and elsewhere", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 6:09 AM", "Content": "PepsiCo lowered its sales forecast for the year as consumers in the U.S., China and elsewhere continued to pull back on buying its snacks and drinks.The company, based in Purchase, New York, said Tuesday it now expects its organic revenue to increase in the low single-digit range for the year.

I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.\nLaurinaitis\u2019 lawyer has denied the allegations, and said Laurinaitis was also a victim in the case.\nGrant says she was pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.\nFour other women \u2014 all formerly affiliated with WWE \u2014 signed agreements with McMahon that bar them from discussing their relationships with him, the Wall Street Journal reported in July 2022, citing people familiar with the deals and documents it reviewed. Grant was not among those women, her representatives say.\nIn December 2022, McMahon agreed to pay a female former wrestling referee millions of dollars to settle her allegations that he raped her in 1986, the Journal also reported. McMahon said the alleged sexual assault never happened, and his lawyer said he settled the suit to avoid costly litigation.\nGrant's request for the Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE to waive enforcement of the NDAs is similar to ones made to other companies when sexual misconduct allegations arose.\nIn 2018 and 2019, respectively, the Weinstein Co. and NBC Universal released employees, former employees and others from NDAs made in connection with sexual misconduct claims against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer.\nVictims' lawyers call NDAs instruments to silence accusers while allowing alleged abusers to avoid accountability. A federal law approved in 2022 and similar laws in more than a dozen states curb the use of NDAs that block victims of sexual harassment from speaking publicly about their allegations.\nThe Associated Press does not normally name people who make sexual assault allegations unless they come forward publicly, which Grant did.\nShe alleges McMahon forced her into a sexual relationship with him in order for her to get and keep a job, and later directed her to have sexual relations with others including Laurinaitis. She also accuses McMahon and Laurinaitis of sexually assaulting her at WWE headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.\nThe lawsuit further claims McMahon recruited other people for sexual relations with Grant, shared pornographic photos and videos of her with other men including WWE employees despite saying he wouldn\u2019t and subjected her to cruel and humiliating acts.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/inflation-returned-normal-election/story?id=114568961", "Title": "Inflation has returned to normal. What does that mean for the election?", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 5:07 AM", "Content": "As the U.S. hurtles toward a presidential election this fall, the nation\u2019s inflation rate has quietly returned to normal, even as it continues to worry voters and draw focus at campaign events.More than half of adults list inflation as a top issue for the country, making it the highest-ranking concern by a wide margin over the likes of immigration, crime and abortion, according to an Ipsos poll conducted late last month.\nThe disconnect stems in part from a typical lag between when inflation comes down and when consumers acclimate to new price levels, since a lower inflation rate does not mean prices have come down but rather that they have begun to increase at a slower pace, experts told ABC News.\nWhile consumer attitudes have brightened in recent months, many people remain frustrated with the cumulative leap in prices over recent years. The trend carries uncertain implications for the contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, since persistent concern about inflation could hurt Harris but recent improvement in sentiment may blunt some of the negative impact.\n\u201cInflation is really something that takes people a long time to feel better about,\u201d Chris Jackson, senior vice president of public affairs for Ipsos in the U.S., told ABC News.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly better for Harris to have inflation coming down than going up, but it\u2019d be better for her if it came down six months earlier,\u201d Jackson added. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s very much a toss-up.\u201d\nInflation has slowed dramatically from a peak of about 9% in 2022, hovering right near the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%.\nSome household staples have shown major progress. Gas prices have declined sharply in recent months. While food prices are rising at a slower pace than the overall inflation rate, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. By contrast, housing prices continue to climb at a rate more than double overall price increases, the data found.\nWhile overall inflation has returned to normal, the progress cannot undo a leap in prices that dates back to the pandemic. Since the outset of 2021, consumer prices have skyrocketed more than 20%.\nThat accumulated rise in prices helps explain why people think inflation remains high, even if it has fallen to a level widely viewed by economists as normal, said Sofia Baig, an economist at the polling firm Morning Consult.\n\u201cThere's a mismatch of where people think inflation is and where economists think inflation is,\u201d Baig said. \u201cMany people seem not to see inflation has come down because prices are so much higher.\u201d\nEventually consumers get used to elevated price levels in the aftermath of high price increases, but the process takes up to three years starting at peak inflation, Neale Mahoney, a professor of economics at Stanford University and a former special adviser for economic policy to the White House National Economic Council under Biden, told ABC News. Roughly two years and four months have passed since inflation reached its peak in June 2022.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where inflation concerns are starting to recede,\u201d Neale said.\nAttitudes about the economy have improved since 2022, data shows. Consumer sentiment ticked upward in August, the most recent month on record, but attitudes remain well below pre-pandemic levels, a University of Michigan survey found.\nPartisanship also plays a significant role in how individuals perceive inflation, making dissatisfaction more persistent among conservatives than liberals, experts said.\nRoughly 80% of adults who consume conservative media said they had not seen costs for groceries or gasoline go down, while 17% had seen a decrease, the Ipsos survey in September showed. For adults who consume mainstream media, 46% said they had not seen prices for those items fall, while 47% said they had seen such a decline, the poll found.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to separate people\u2019s feelings about the economy from their feelings about politics,\u201d said Jackson.\nStill, the prevalence of stubborn perceptions of inflation could hurt Harris, though the uptick in consumer sentiment could limit the damage, some experts said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think things will change in time for the election,\u201d said Baig, but she noted the improvement in attitudes among consumers. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing if you're the incumbent party but it\u2019s still not where it used to be.\u201d\nThe exact trajectory for prices and the economy remains uncertain, experts said, leaving open the question of how it will factor into the election.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/facebook-youtube-tiktok-users-europe-forum-challenge-social-114587858", "Title": "Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users in Europe get forum to challenge social media content decisions", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:32 AM", "Content": "LONDON -- Social media users in the European Union will soon have a new forum to challenge decisions by platforms to remove posts and videos for breaking their rules or leave up others that may violate them.An \u201cout of court dispute settlement body\u201d named the Appeals Center Europe said Tuesday it has been certified by Irish regulators to act as a referee on content moderation disputes across the 27-nation EU, starting with cases involving Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. \nThe center is similar to Meta\u2019s Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body set up in 2020 that acts like a supreme court for thorny decisions about content moderation issues on Facebook, Instagram and Threads submitted by users around the world. \nUnder the EU's digital rulebook known as the Digital Services Act, or DSA, tech companies and social media platforms are required to work with dispute settlement bodies and comply with any decisions they make. EU officials in Brussels wanted to give EU citizens a way to challenge any decisions made by Big Tech companies as they sought to balance the right to free speech against the goal of curbing online risks. \nThe center will hear appeals from users or groups located in the EU about \u201ceverything from violence and incitement to hate speech to bullying and harassment,\u201d CEO Thomas Hughes said. \n\u201cIt could be everything from a case that relates to a head of state all the way through to a neighborly dispute,\u201d Hughes said. \nThe Digital Services Act is a sweeping set of regulations that requires tech and social media companies operating in Europe to clean up their platforms under threat of hefty fines. \nThe Appeals Center, based in Dublin, where many Silicon Valley companies have their European headquarters, will start hearing cases from users before the end of the year. It's initially dealing with Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users because it wanted to start with the biggest platforms, with plans to add others later. \nUnlike the Oversight Board, which can cherry pick the biggest and most important cases, the center will have to rule on every case it gets. And decisions won\u2019t be publicly available, unlike Oversight Board judgments that are posted online. \n The Oversight Board both issues binding decisions on individual cases, such as ruling in September on three separate posts with the controversial Palestinian rallying cry \u201c from the river to the sea,\" and also weighs in on wider policy issues with non-binding recommendations, such as guidance in July on updating Meta's policies on non-consensual deepfakes after reviewing a case involving deepfake intimate images of two women. \nThe Appeals Center\u2019s decisions, in contrast, aren't binding and will be limited to whether content such as a post, photo or video violates each platform\u2019s rules. \nHughes said the center will hire staff from across the EU to handle what he said could be up to tens of thousands of cases each year. The staff will have expertise in specific regions, languages and policy areas. \nBeyond the individual decisions on cases, data on the disputes will help regulators and researchers map out any \u201csystemic risks\u201d to social media users. \nThe Real Facebook Oversight Board, a group of civil rights leaders and tech experts that has been critical of Meta and its oversight panel, gave a cautious welcome to the new centre. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t know a lot about the appeals center and how it will work, but moderation enforcement under the DSA has promise that other approaches do not,\" said spokesman Ben Wyskida. While the DSA \u201chasn't been perfect ... it is still far and away superior to anything in the United States.\u201d \nMeta's Oversight Board is providing 15 million euros ($16.5 million) in startup funding, said Hughes, who was previously the Oversight Board's director. He added that the two bodies will operate separately but will \u201cpoint in the same direction in terms of platform accountability and transparency, user rights\u201d and applying a human rights framework to online speech. \nThe Appeals Center will fund its ongoing operations by charging tech companies 95 euros for every case it hears, as well as a 5 euro fee from users who raise disputes. This \"nominal\" fee is intended to stop people from \u201cgaming or abusing\u201d the system and will be refunded if a user wins, Hughes said. \nEven though decisions aren't binding, users will still get their money back if the center rules in favor of their disputes, regardless of whether or not the platform takes any action.\nThere's a 90-day deadline for decisions, but in most cases they will be made much more quickly, he said. \n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/hong-kongs-hang-seng-index-plunges-95-investors-114587667", "Title": "Hong Kong's Hang Seng index plunges 9.5% as investors dump shares after recent sharp gains", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 4:06 AM", "Content": "Video\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/nobel-prize-physics-awarded-2-scientists-discoveries-enabled-114589131", "Title": "Pioneers in artificial intelligence win the Nobel Prize in physics", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:50 AM", "Content": "STOCKHOLM -- Two pioneers of artificial intelligence \u2014 John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton \u2014 won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for helping create the building blocks of machine learning that is revolutionizing the way we work and live but also creates new threats for humanity.Hinton, who is known as the godfather of artificial intelligence, is a citizen of Canada and Britain who works at the University of Toronto, and Hopfield is an American working at Princeton.\n\u201cThese two gentlemen were really the pioneers,\u201d said Nobel physics committee member Mark Pearce.\nThe artificial neural networks \u2014 interconnected computer nodes inspired by neurons in the human brain \u2014 the researchers pioneered are used throughout science and medicine and \u201chave also become part of our daily lives,\" said Ellen Moons of the Nobel committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nHopfield, whose 1982 work laid the groundwork for Hinton's, told The Associated Press, \u201cI continue to be amazed by the impact it has had.\"\nHinton predicted that AI will end up having a \u201chuge influence\u201d on civilization, bringing improvements in productivity and health care.\n\u201cIt would be comparable with the Industrial Revolution,\u201d he said in an open call with reporters and officials of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\u201cWe have no experience of what it\u2019s like to have things smarter than us. And it\u2019s going to be wonderful in many respects,\u201d Hinton said. \n\u201cBut we also have to worry about a number of possible bad consequences, particularly the threat of these things getting out of control.\u201d\nThe Nobel committee also mentioned fears about the possible flipside. \nMoons said that while it has \"enormous benefits, its rapid development has also raised concerns about our future. Collectively, humans carry the responsibility for using this new technology in a safe and ethical way for the greatest benefit of humankind.\u201d\nHinton, who quit a role at Google so he could speak more freely about the dangers of the technology he helped create, shares those concerns.\n\u201cI am worried that the overall consequence of this might be systems more intelligent than us that eventually take control,\u201d Hinton said.\nFor his part, Hopfield, who signed early petitions by researchers calling for strong control of the technology, compared the risks and benefits to work on viruses and nuclear energy, capable of helping and harming society. At a Princeton news conference, he made reference to the concerns, bringing up the dystopia imagined in George Orwell's \u201c1984,\u201d or the fictional apocalypse inadvertently created by a Nobel-winning physicist in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s \u201cCat\u2019s Cradle.\u201d\nHopfield, who was staying with his wife at a cottage in Hampshire, England, said that after grabbing coffee and getting his flu shot, he opened his computer to a flurry of activity.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that many emails in my life,\u201d he said. A bottle of champagne and bowl of soup were waiting, he added, but he doubted there were any fellow physicists in town to join the celebration.\nHinton said he was shocked at the honor.\n\u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted. I had no idea this would happen,\u201d he said when reached by the Nobel committee on the phone. He said he was at a cheap hotel with no internet.\nHinton, 76, helped develop a technique in the 1980s known as backpropagation instrumental in training machines how to \u201clearn\" by fine-tuning errors until they disappear. It\u2019s similar to the way a student learns, with an initial solution graded and flaws identified and returned to be fixed and repaired. This process continues until the answer matches the network\u2019s version of reality.\nHinton had an unconventional background as a psychologist who also dabbled in carpentry and was genuinely curious about how the mind works, said protege Nick Frosst, who was Hinton\u2019s first hire at Google\u2019s AI division in Toronto.\nHis \u201cplayfulness and genuine interest in answering fundamental questions I think is key to his success as a scientist,\u201d Frosst said. \nNor did he stop at his pioneering 1980s work.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been consistently trying out crazy things and some of them work very well and some of them don\u2019t,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cBut they all have contributed to the success of the field and galvanized other researchers to try new things as well.\u201d \nHinton's team at the University of Toronto wowed peers by using a neural network to win the prestigious ImageNet computer vision competition in 2012. That spawned a flurry of copycats and was \u201ca very, very significant moment in hindsight and in the course of AI history,\u201d said Stanford University computer scientist and ImageNet creator Fei-Fei Li.\n\u201cMany people consider that the birth of modern AI,\u201d she said.\nHinton and fellow AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun won computer science\u2019s top prize, the Turing Award, in 2019.\n\u201cFor a long time, people thought what the three of us were doing was nonsense,\u201d Hinton told the AP in 2019. \"My message to young researchers is, don\u2019t be put off if everyone tells you what you are doing is silly.\u201d\nMany of Hinton's former students and collaborators followed him into the tech industry as it began capitalizing on AI innovations, and some started their own AI companies, including Frosst's Cohere and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Hinton said he uses machine learning tools in his daily life.\n\u201cWhenever I want to know the answer to anything, I just go and ask GPT-4,\u201d Hinton said at the Nobel announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t totally trust it because it can hallucinate, but on almost everything it's a not-very-good expert. And that\u2019s very useful.\u201d\nHopfield, 91, created an associative memory that can store and reconstruct images and other types of patterns in data, the Nobel committee said. \nJust as Hinton came to the field from psychology, Hopfield stressed how cutting edge science comes from crossing the borders of scientific fields like physics, biology and chemistry instead of researchers staying in their lane. It's why this prize is a physics prize, he said, pointing out that his neural network borrows from condensed matter physics.\nWith big complex problems in scientific fields, \u201cif you are not motivated by physics, you just don't tackle the class of problems,\u201d Hopfield said.\nWhile there's no Nobel for computer science, Li said that awarding a traditional science prize to AI pioneers is significant and shows how boundaries between disciplines have blurred. \nNot all of their peers agree with the Nobel laureates about the risks of the technology they helped create.\nFrosst has had many \u201cspirited debates\u201d with Hinton about AI\u2019s risks and disagrees with some of Hinton\u2019s warnings but not his willingness to publicly address them.\n\u201cMostly we disagree on timescale and on the particular technology that he\u2019s sounding the alarm on,\u201d Frosst said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that neural nets and language models as they exist today pose an existential risk.\u201d\nBengio, who has long voiced concerns about AI risks, said what really alarms him and Hinton is \u201closs of human control\u201d and whether AI systems will act morally when they're smarter than humans.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the answer to these questions,\u201d he said. \"And we should make sure we do before we build those machines.\u201d\nAsked whether the Nobel committee might have factored in Hinton\u2019s warnings when deciding on the award, Bengio dismissed that, saying \u201cwe\u2019re talking about very early work when we thought that everything would be rosy.\u201d\nSix days of Nobel announcements opened Monday with Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the medicine prize. They continue with the chemistry prize Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the economics award on Oct. 14.\nThe prize carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million) from a bequest left by the award's creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel\u2019s death.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/china-imposes-provisional-tariffs-european-brandy-after-eu-114586979", "Title": "China puts provisional tariffs on European brandy after EU OKs duties on Chinese EVs", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 8, 2024, 3:08 AM", "Content": "BEIJING -- Chinese drinkers may pay more for Remy Martin and other European brandies after the government announced on Tuesday provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on those liquors, four days after a majority of European Union countries approved duties on electric vehicles made in China.The tit-for-tat move potentially gives Chinese negotiators leverage in talks with the EU on reducing or eliminating the tariffs of up to 35.3% on Chinese EVs, which would take effect at the end of this month.\nThe brandy tariffs are provisional and require importers to make a deposit with the Chinese customs agency for the amount of the tariff, starting Friday. \nThe announcement followed a preliminary finding by China's Commerce Ministry in late August that European brandy was being dumped in China, threatening \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to domestic producers.\nChina has opened a series of anti-dumping investigations into European brandy, pork and dairy products as a now year-old EU investigation into Chinese EV exports has progressed through various stages. \nThe brandy probe was the first and targeted mainly French makers of cognac and similar spirits such as Armagnac.

The piecemeal nature of the plans announced Tuesday appeared to disappoint investors who were hoping for bolder moves, and Shanghai's benchmark gave up a 10% initial gain as markets reopened after a weeklong holiday to trade just 3% higher. \nThe head of the National Development and Reform Commission said the government will frontload 100 billion yuan ($14.1 billion) in spending from the government\u2019s budget for 2025 in addition to another 100 billion yuan for construction projects. \nThe scale of spending overall was well below the multi-trillion yuan levels that analysts said might be expected. \nThe NDRC\u2019s chairman, Zheng Shanjie, said China was still on track to attain its full-year economic growth target of around 5%. But he acknowledged the economy faces difficulties and an increasingly \u201cmore complex and extreme\u201d global environment.\nChina's leaders have been struggling to rev up growth since the COVID-19 pandemic ended.

Those and other measures were the most aggressive efforts so far to try to pull the property industry out of the doldrums and spur faster growth. \nOn Tuesday, the NDRC said that new measures would focus on boosting investment and spending and supporting small and medium-sized businesses that operate at a disadvantage to large, state-corporations.\nBut much of the information focused on technical issues such as payment regulations, management of projects and deployment of bonds for financing. \nTo counter falling housing sales and home prices, Zheng said there would be \u201ccomprehensive policy measures to help stop the decline in the real estate market.\u201d\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stock-market-today-chinese-shares-soar-fade-beijing-114585388", "Title": "Stock market today: Wall Street rebounds after Hong Kong stocks fall to worst day since 2008", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:44 PM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks rebounded Tuesday after falling oil prices released some of the pressure that built up on the market.The S&P 500 rallied 1% to claw back all of its loss from the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 126 points, or 0.3%, and likewise neared its record set last week, while the Nasdaq composite led the way with a 1.4% rally.\nWall Street held firm even though stock markets around the world sank following scary swings in China, as euphoria about possible stimulus for the world\u2019s second-largest economy gave way to disappointment. Stocks tumbled 9.4% in Hong Kong for their worst day since the 2008 global financial crisis.\nHelping to support Wall Street was a sharp drawdown in oil prices. They gave back some of the big recent gains they made on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nA barrel of Brent crude, the international standard, fell 4.6% to $77.18 for its first loss in a week and a half. A barrel of benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, eased 4.6% to $73.57.\nThat also helped level off the pressure on the stock market from the bond market. Treasury yields eased a bit, a day after they shot to their highest levels since the summer.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield edged down to 4.02 from 4.03% late Monday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with overnight interest rates, slipped to 3.96% from 3.99%, late Monday, though it\u2019s still near its highest level since August.\nWhen Treasurys are paying higher yields, investors generally become less willing to pay very high prices for stocks and other investments. And Treasury yields had been storming higher over the last week following a suite of reports showing the U.S. economy remains healthier than expected.\nSuch reports, including one last week showing stronger hiring by U.S. employers  than forecast, raise hopes that the economy will avoid a recession. But they also force traders to ratchet back expectations for how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by, now that it has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation.\nTraders have abandoned expectations for the Fed to cut its main interest rate by a larger-than-usual half of a percentage point at its next meeting, for example. Instead, they\u2019re largely betting on a traditional-sized cut of a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group. Some are even calling for the possibility the Fed could keep its main rate steady in November. \nHigh Treasury yields put the most pressure on stocks seen as the most expensive, and that puts the spotlight on the Big Tech stocks that have led the market for most of the last few years. \nOn Tuesday, all of the Big Tech stocks that have collectively come to be called the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d rose.

A top lieutenant for Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey opened what's expected to be multiple weeks of witnesses, evidence and arguments by attorneys for the state Insurance Department and the North Carolina Rate Bureau, which represents insurance companies seeking the increase. \nIn over 2,000 pages of data filed last January, the Rate Bureau sought proposed increases varying widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to 99% in some beach areas. Proposed increases in and around big cities like Raleigh, Charlotte and Greensboro are roughly 40%. \nAcross 11 western counties that were hit hard by Helene, including Asheville's Buncombe County, the requested increase is 20.5%. The percentages are based on insurance payouts of years past and future claims projections.\nAfter taking public comment, Causey rejected the request in February, prompting the hearing. In previous rounds of premium rate requests, the industry and the commissioner have negotiated settlements before a hearing. Before the last such hearing set for early 2022, they settled weeks earlier on a 7.9% average premium rate increase after the bureau had sought 24.5%. \nThis time, Causey told reporters Monday, \u201cwe were not able to come anywhere close, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.\u201d\nWhen the hearing ends, the hearing officer, in consultation with Causey, will decide within 45 days whether the proposed rates are excessive, and if so, issue an order that sets new rates. That order could be challenged at the state Court of Appeals. \nRate Bureau attorney Mickey Spivey told hearing officer Amy Funderburk that the highest inflation in 40 years \u2014 particularly on building materials \u2014 combined with calamitous storms that are \"getting worse and worse\u201d show that current premium rates are \"severely inadequate.\" \nSpivey cited Helene, which inflicted unprecedented destruction in the state's western mountain communities, as well as Hurricane Florence in 2018, which caused billions of dollars of in damage in eastern North Carolina, much of it paid for by insurance companies. \nNot mentioned Monday: Hurricane Milton, which grew explosively to a Category 5 hurricane while closing in on Florida on a path expected to mostly miss North Carolina.\n\u201cWhether you want to call it climate change or not, there is no denying that we are having bigger, stronger and more costly catastrophic storms than we\u2019ve seen in any of our lifetimes,\u201d Spivey said. \nThe Insurance Department's attorney, Terence Friedman, argued that the industry continues to use actuarial methods that ignore what state law requires in calculating rates increases.\nFriedman said the bureau's requested rates are inflated and that the department's actuaries will demonstrate there are \u201dalternative recommended rates that will allow the bureau\u2019s members to earn what they\u2019re constitutionally entitled to.\" \nBut Spivey said the Insurance Department's witnesses would seek to actually lower premium rates, or limit increases by less than 3%. \nNot every owner's premiums will go up or down by the final approved rates; there are other factors insurers consider in setting a bill.\nWithout a fair profit and the ability to cover claims, Spivey said, industry companies will have to invoke a legal exception more frequently insuring high-risk homeowners only if they agree to pay premiums at rates that are up to 250% of the bureau's rate. Otherwise, he said, more insurers will stop issuing policies altogether. \nThe \u201cconsent to rate\u201d exception in North Carolina\u2019s law has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers, as some states have experienced, said David Marlett, an insurance professor at Appalachian State University. \nWhile each state has different models to regulate rates, those affected by more hurricanes and storms are essentially faced with two options, Marlett said: Allow rates to keep rising to cover claims, or \u201csomehow we build structures that are able to withstand climate change.\u201d\nFriedman criticized the bureau for citing Helene in its opening statement, saying it shouldn\u2019t be used as grounds to raise rates on the storm\u2019s survivors. He also noted that most of Helene's damage was caused by flooding, which is covered separately from the homeowners' policies now being considered.\nThe proceedings are likely to continue after early voting begins on Oct. 17. Causey, a two-term Republican commissioner, is being challenged by Democrat Natasha Marcus, a state senator. \nMarcus held a news conference outside the Insurance Department headquarters criticizing Causey for declining to preside over the hearing, calling it a \u201cridiculous dereliction of one of his major duties in this job.\u201d She also lamented that any decision will be made after Election Day. \nCausey said he's not hearing the case in part because he\u2019s not an attorney. State law allows him to pick someone else to preside over the hearing, which is a quasi-judicial proceeding. \n__\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/federal-judge-orders-google-open-android-app-store-114574997", "Title": "Federal judge orders Google to open its Android app store to competition", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 4:26 PM", "Content": "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Monday ordered Google to tear down the digital walls shielding its Android app store from competition as punishment for maintaining an illegal monopoly that helped expand the company's internet empire. The injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Donato will require Google to make several changes that the Mountain View, California, company had been resisting. Those include a provision that will require its Play Store for Android apps to distribute rival third-party app stores so consumers can download them to their phones, if they so desire.\nThe judge\u2019s order will also make the millions of Android apps in the Play Store library accessible to rivals, allowing them to offer up a competitive selection.\nDonato is giving Google until November to make the revisions dictated in his order. The company had insisted it would take 12 to 16 months to design the safeguards needed to reduce the chances of potentially malicious software making its way into rival Android app stores and infecting millions of Samsung phones and other mobile devices running on its free Android software.\nThe court-mandated overhaul is meant to prevent Google from walling off competition in the Android app market as part of an effort to protect a commission system that has been a boon for one of the world's most prosperous companies and helped elevate the market value of its corporate parent Alphabet Inc. to $2 trillion.\nGoogle said in a blog post that it will ask the court to pause the pending changes, and will appeal the court\u2019s decision.\nDonato also ruled that, for a period of three years ending Nov. 1, 2027, Google won't be able to share revenue from its Play Store with anyone who distributes Android apps or is considering launching an Android app distribution platform or store. It also won't be allowed to pay developers, or share revenue, so that they will launch an app in the Google Play Store first or exclusively, and can't make deals with manufacturers to preinstall the Google Play store on any specific location on an Android device. It also won't be able to require apps to use its billing system or tell customers that they can download apps elsewhere and potentially for cheaper. \nThe Play Store has been earning billions of dollars annually for years, primarily through 15% to 30% commissions that Google has been imposing on digital transactions completed within Android apps. It's a similar fee structure to the one that Apple deploys in its iPhone app store \u2014 a structure that prompted video game maker Epic Games to file antitrust lawsuits four years ago in an effort to foster competition that could help drive down prices for both app makers and consumers.\nA federal judge mostly sided with Apple in a September 2021 decision that was upheld by an appeals court. Still, a jury favored Epic Games after the completion of a four-week trial completed last year and delivered a verdict that tarred the Play Store as an illegal monopoly.\nThat prompted another round of hearings this year to help Donato determine what steps should be taken to restore fair competition. Google argued that Epic Games was seeking some extreme changes, saddling the company with costs that could run as high as $600 billion. Epic contended Google could level the playing field for as little as $1 million. It's unclear how much the changes ordered by Donato will cost Google. \nAlthough Epic lost its antitrust case against Apple, Donato's ruling could still have ripple effects on the iPhone app store as another federal judge weighs whether Apple is making it easy enough to promote different ways that consumers can pay for digital transactions. Apple was ordered to allow in-app links to alternative payment systems as part of U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers' decision in that case, but Epic contends the provision is being undermined with the creation of another commission system that stifles consumer choice.\nThe forthcoming Play Store shakeup could be just the first unwelcome shock that antitrust law delivers to Google. In the biggest antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department in a quarter century, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in August declared Google's dominant search engine to be an illegal monopoly, too, and is now getting ready to start hearings on how to punish Google for that bad behavior. Google is appealing Mehta's ruling in the search engine case in hopes of warding off a penalty that could hurt its business even more than the changes being ordered in the Play Store. \n\u201cProvided the ruling survives the appeals process, Google will almost certainly take a revenue hit,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf. \u201cNo doubt some of the largest app developers like Epic Games will start encroaching on Google Play Store\u2019s market share, meaning Google will lose out on its usual cut of subscription and in-app purchases.\u201d\nThe analyst added that, while the Google Play Store will likely continue to benefit from brand recognition since it was the default Android app store for so long, \u201csome consumers may defect if they can get better deals on their favorite apps elsewhere.\u201d And app developers will likely take advantage of the opportunity to let consumers know about direct downloads. \n\u201cSo Google may see fewer Play Store revenues even among the Android users that stick to the default,\u201d Mitchell-Wolf said.\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/major-us-stock-indexes-fared-monday-1072024-114574881", "Title": "How major US stock indexes fared Monday, 10/7/2024", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 4:25 PM", "Content": "U.S. stocks slid after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.The S&P 500 fell 1% Monday, though it\u2019s still close to its all-time high set a week ago.

The program was an inspiration for Gentry, who had launched a college-access program in rural eastern Kentucky about a decade earlier.\u201cWe realized that college access actually starts at birth,\u201d Gentry says. \u201cIt starts with the family, and it starts with the place.\u201d She and her staff soon began to modify their approach.\nA breakthrough came that year when Gentry\u2019s group \u2014 today called Partners for Rural Impact, or PRI \u2014 received a Promise Neighborhood grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The federal effort helps communities design anti-poverty projects modeled after the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone\u2019s \u201ccradle-to-career\u201d approach. PRI became one of the first organizations, and the first rural effort, to receive the grant.\nToday, the organization helps leaders in rural towns and districts identify programming gaps and tap into comprehensive educational, medical, and social services \u2014 largely funded by federal grants. It measures community progress across a indicators like kindergarten readiness, third-grade reading, eighth-grade math, and high school graduation rates. Many of those areas saw substantial improvement over the past decade, although the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted progress.\nNow two funders \u2014 the Ballmer Group and Blue Meridian Partners \u2014 along with regional grantmakers and individual donors, are supporting PRI to adapt the model it honed in Appalachia for rural places in Texas, Missouri, and beyond.\n\u201cIt quickly became clear to us that Dreama\u2019s vision for this field and this work was much broader than what she was doing in Appalachia,\u201d says Cecilia Gutierrez, a managing director at Blue Meridian Partners.\nThe grantmaker gave PRI $2 million in 2023 for its work in Kentucky. Now a second two-year grant of $5 million is helping the nonprofit assist other rural communities to develop partnerships among schools, local governments, health-care systems, and other sectors to improve the lives of students.\nRural areas tend to have fewer and less accessible institutional resources than suburban or urban places, says Jeff Edmondson, executive director of community impact at the Ballmer Group. For that reason, he says, the role of an organization that helps keep a diverse group of community leaders on track to meet common goals is particularly important \u201cto ensure that they\u2019re using very limited resources as efficiently and effectively as possible.\u201d\nThis year, the Ballmer Group committed $12.5 million over five years to support PRI\u2019s efforts to assist other regions in forging community partnerships that help improve the lives of students. That\u2019s in addition to the $2.58 million the Ballmer Group has contributed to PRI since 2022.\nIn the past year, PRI began working in two towns in rural East Texas and Mexico, Missouri, the hometown of Tyronn Lue, head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers. Lue provided $2.5 million to support that work alongside Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO and Ballmer Group founder who owns the NBA team.\nOver the next four and a half years, PRI plans to identify two more regions or towns to launch locally led partnerships. The idea is that these communities, along with those in Kentucky, Missouri, and Texas, will serve as \u201cproof of concept\u201d for what can work to improve education outcomes for rural families, says Gentry. \u201cOur goal is that a superintendent in a rural place who\u2019s really considering doing a collective impact, place-based partnership could say, \u2018Hey, we see ourself in one of those five places and recognize that works in rural America.\u2019\u201d\nNo matter where PRI sets up shop, the work is led by locals, Gentry says.\nPRI Appalachia has a service area that spans 31 counties and 42 school districts. In Leslie County, where executive director Amon Couch was born and his father worked in the coal mines, the population is declining as people leave for better economic opportunities. The school system serves around 1,500 students, down from more than 3,500 students 30 years ago.\nTransportation is a major challenge as population density declines, and the area is a resource desert in terms of health and dental care. \u201cThe needs of our students are the greatest they\u2019ve ever been, financially,\u201d says Brett Wilson, the district superintendent. Around 70% of students receive some type of public assistance.\nLast year, the district transported hundreds of students to dental checkups through a partnership with a local health system and using money from a grant through the Department of Education\u2019s Full-Service Community Schools program and a local philanthropy.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t learn English or math or anything else when your teeth are throbbing,\u201d Couch says.\nFederal and state grants will always be PRI\u2019s bread and butter, Gentry says. \u201cPublic dollars should support education,\u201d she says. Today Partners for Rural Impact\u2019s budget is around $78.2 million, with 78% coming from the government.\nIt\u2019s often a challenge for rural communities to come up with the matching funds some federal grants require. But philanthropy helps fill in the gaps, providing matching dollars to pay the 60 or so AmeriCorps members who work with PRI in a given year.\nRural areas are at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting philanthropy.\nA 2015 U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis found that from 2005 to 2010, rural areas received just 5 to 6% of foundation grant dollars. A 2021 FSG report found that share increased marginally to 7%, even though those communities account for 14 to 20% of the population. depending on the definition of \u201crural.\u201d\nGrantmakers\u2019 focus on how many people they can serve always puts rural groups at a disadvantage, Gentry says. But she\u2019s successfully made the case that while total population numbers may be lower, donors can have a deeper impact outside of urban areas.\n\u201cYour scale could be doing the same intervention in multiple rural places around the country,\u201d she says.\nIn rural East Texas, the T.L.L. Temple Foundation has committed $2 million over five years with an additional $1 million in matching funds to help PRI establish a presence in Diboll and Pineland.\n\u201cThe issues we deal with in rural communities are very similar to what you see in urban communities \u2014 transportation, access to health care, access to child care, food deserts, lack of broadband,\u201d says Wynn Rosser, the foundation\u2019s president. \u201cThe issues just express themselves differently when the context is rural and remote.\u201d\nThe foundation is the region's largest grantmaker, with wealth from the Temple family, who owned a lumber and paper manufacturing company. It has long funded efforts to increase rates of third-grade literacy and math and help more high school students earn postsecondary credentials aligned to the region\u2019s labor market.\nAlready, PRI has helped bring together schools, colleges, nonprofits, and other community programs to work toward common goals and attract new federal funding, Rosser says. \u201cTheir method works, their leadership works, their belief in rural people and rural communities, all those things are already coming through.\u201d\n_____\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/judge-rules-ftc-proceed-antitrust-lawsuit-amazon-tosses-114569981", "Title": "Judge rules the FTC can proceed with antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, tosses out few state claims", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 2:08 PM", "Content": "A federal judge said the Federal Trade Commission can proceed with its landmark antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.

By ruling that some FIFA regulations on player transfers are contrary to EU legislation relating to competition and freedom of movement, the bloc's top court has paved the way for deep changes in the sport's economy. \nHere is a look at the key elements of the case and the possible impact of the landmark ruling. \nLassana Diarra is a former much-traveled footballer whose career saw him play for prestigious clubs such as Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. He represented France 34 times. At one point in his career, Diarra moved to the Russian league. It\u2019s a dispute with Lokomotiv Moscow that triggered the legal case examined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\nDiarra signed a four-year contract with Lokomotiv in 2013. The deal was terminated a year later after he was unhappy with alleged pay cuts. Lokomotiv applied to the FIFA dispute resolution chamber for compensation and the player submitted a counterclaim seeking compensation for unpaid wages. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found the Russian club terminated the contract \u201cwith just cause\u201d and the player had to pay 10.5 million euros ($11.2 million). Diarra said his search for a new team was hampered by FIFA rules stipulating that any new club would be jointly responsible with him for paying compensation to Lokomotiv.\nFree movement is a fundamental right of workers in the European Union within the single market. On that basis, the EU\u2019s top court said that the FIFA rules, including the one that resulted in the refusal to provide Diarra with an international transfer certificate (ITC) for a move to Charleroi, restricted his freedom of movement.\nThe court also found that FIFA regulations breached the bloc\u2019s competition law because they aim at restricting and preventing \u201ccross-border competition which could be pursued by all clubs established in the European Union.\u201d\nThe ECJ ruling will now be referred back to the appeal court in Mons, Belgium, which will rule on the Diarra case. This could take years rather than months. Although FIFA said it was satisfied \u201cthat the legality of key principles of the transfer system have been reconfirmed,\u201d Diarra\u2019s lawyers claimed \u201ctotal victory.\u201d\nThe judges in Luxembourg acknowledged having stability in player rosters and regularity in competitions are legitimate objectives for FIFA, but that rules must be applied proportionally. \nSome analysts have compared it to the ECJ\u2019s 1995 decision on Belgian Jean-Marc Bosman. That ruling removed restrictions placed on foreign EU footballers within national leagues and allowed players in the bloc to move to another club for free when their contracts ended. Those principles had an obviously wider focus than the narrower scope of Diarra, about terminating a contract for cause. \nFor now, the decision on Diarra does not change how the transfer market functions. But many legal experts believe that the ruling will ultimately have major effects on the sport\u2019s economy.\n\u201cThe decision essentially says the current system is too restrictive and so will have to change,\u201d said Ian Giles, a partner at Norton Rose Fulbright law firm. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible this means players will feel they can now break contracts and sign on with new clubs, without the selling club being able to hold them or demand significant transfer fees. This will likely result in reduced transfer fees and more economic power for players \u2014 but over time things will have to stabilize to allow clubs to remain economically viable.\"\nIt took more than five years after the Bosman ruling for updated FIFA transfer rules to be published in 2001. Some of those debates then will now be revisited. \nA major reset of transfer fee values can seriously affect many smaller market clubs. Bosman already accelerated gaps in wealth and competitive balance across European soccer, which is increasingly dominated by a small group of clubs. They can lure free-agent players with higher signing bonuses and salaries \u2013 money that previously would be more widely distributed via transfer fees. \nSpending by super-wealthy clubs can still reward smaller ones who excel at investing time and expertise in scouting and developing local and global talent: Ajax, Brighton, Genk in Belgium, which nurtured Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois and Leandro Trossard.\nThe influential European Club Association, which represents more than 700 teams, sees potential threats to the industry\u2019s health in the fallout from Diarra. Transfer fees and payments to clubs from former players being sold later in their career \u201care an efficient and effective means of wealth distribution from bigger clubs to smaller ones,\u201d the ECA noted.\nThe soccer industry is increasingly a game being played by lawyers in courts and government offices.\nFIFA is being challenged in several legal arenas, in part because it works (Diarra, Super League, agents regulations ). There is also a growing perception FIFA does not listen before launching projects and that pro-transparency reforms demanded and passed a decade ago are in decline. \nWithin hours of the Diarra ruling Friday, the group of domestic leagues and player unions announced a news conference in Brussels for Oct. 14 to explain their filing to the European Commission. The complaint on competition law grounds argues FIFA adds new and bigger tournaments to the congested calendar without proper consultation.\nEuropean Leagues and FIFPRO once had a seat at FIFA\u2019s Football Stakeholders Committee that was a key forum for debate, including on the transfer market. FIFA paused the panel in 2021 and soon its president Gianni Infantino pushed for playing World Cups every two years. The idea was resisted by a widespread backlash. The leagues group says the Diarra ruling shows how representation at FIFA is \u201cbecoming legally essential.\u201d\nFIFA had indicated before Friday it would consult widely on transfer market reforms it believes can focus on specific issues raised by Diarra, rather than a total overhaul. \nDiarra\u2019s lawyer Jean-Louis Dupont \u2014 who also represented Bosman 30 years ago \u2014 sees a bigger picture. He appeared to be recruiting for a wider suit against FIFA by claiming \u201call professional players have been affected by these illegal rules\u201d and could now seek compensation.\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/supreme-court-hear-appeal-elon-musks-platform-warrant-114564610", "Title": "Supreme Court won't hear appeal from Elon Musk\u2019s X platform over warrant in Trump case", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 11:09 AM", "Content": "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said Monday it won\u2019t hear an appeal from the social media platform X over a search warrant prosecutors obtained in the election-interference case against former President Donald Trump.The justices did not explain their reasoning and there were no noted dissents. \nThe company, known as Twitter before it was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk, says a nondisclosure order that blocked it from telling Trump about the warrant obtained by special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team violated its First Amendment rights. \nThe company also argues Trump should have had a chance to exert executive privilege.

After the talks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will offer financial support to the cash-strapped Maldives in form of a $100-million treasury bills rollover. The countries also signed a $400-million currency swap agreement.\nThe two leaders virtually inaugurated a new runway of Hanimaadhoo International Airport in the Maldives, and Modi announced that work will be accelerated on the India-assisted Greater Male Connectivity Project, which aims to link key islands of the Maldives through modern transport networks.\n\u201cIndia is Maldives\u2019 nearest neighbour and a close friend,\u201d Modi said during a joint news conference. He said the Maldives held an important position in India's \u201cneighbourhood first policy.\u201d\nTensions between India and the Maldives have grown since President Mohamed Muizzu, who favors closer ties with China, was elected last year after defeating India-friendly incumbent Ibrahim Mohamed Solih. Leading up to the election, Muizzu had promised to expel Indian soldiers deployed in the Maldives to help with humanitarian assistance. In May, New Delhi replaced dozens of its soldiers with civilian experts.\nIn January, Maldivian leaders lashed out at Modi for promoting India\u2019s Lakshadweep archipelago for Indian travelers. Lakshadweep is off the southwestern coast of the Indian mainland.\nMaldivians saw the move as a way to lure Indian tourists away from their country. It sparked angry protests from Indian celebrities who called for a tourism boycott to the Maldives. Tourism is the mainstay of the Maldives\u2019 economy. \nThe dispute deepened when Muizzu visited China ahead of India in January, a move seen by New Delhi as a snub. On his return, Muizzu spelled out plans to rid his tiny nation of dependence on India for health facilities, medicines and import of staples. \nA thaw ensued after Muizzu attended Modi\u2019s June swearing-in ceremony in New Delhi for a third five-year term.

They materialize from villages and form a crowd around the vehicle, watching closely as crews weigh and load the crated fruits. Such roadside exchanges, repeated regularly during peak harvest season, long provided a ready market for smallholder avocado growers in a country that\u2019s sometimes ranked as the world\u2019s poorest. But the transactions now promise real earnings thanks in part to the intervention of the national government and farmers\u2019 cooperatives that worked to set terms for foreign avocado dealers. \nJust a year ago, farmers selling their avocados to the transporters earned 10 cents per kilogram (2.2 pounds), far less than the price for a small bottle of water. These days, they get roughly 70 cents for the same quantity, a meaningful increase for people who mainly farm to feed their families. \nA major change in the trade is that payments in U.S. currency now go into the bank accounts of cooperatives that pay their members directly almost as soon as the avocado haulers leave. Acting as intermediaries, groups such as Green Gold Burundi, which has its headquarters in the northern province of Kayanza and represents 200,000 farmers nationwide, say they are better positioned than individual growers to stem exploitation.\nThe participation of the cooperatives is an important step toward regulating the country's avocado exports, said Ferdinand Habimana, vice president of Green Gold Burundi\u2019s administrative board. Although the government is promoting avocado farming to diversify exports, avocados grown in Burundi are yet to be trademarked as coming from there, he said. \n\u201cSo it is legally done now, but what we are developing now is that the (avocados) can reach the final destination as avocados taken from Burundi,\u201d said Habimana, speaking of his group\u2019s dealings with exporters in Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa. \nZacharie Munezero, who oversees quality management for Green Gold Burundi, acknowledged that the 70 cents farmers earn for a kilogram of avocados is still insufficient when exporters can fetch between $3 and $5 for the same quantity in international markets.\nAvocados are cheap in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where they can be purchased from farmers in bulk for almost nothing. In Burundi, avocados became more widely cultivated after the country's former leader, Pierre Nkurunziza, started extolling the fruit in 2007 as a source of nutrition and income. \nMany households that don\u2019t produce the varieties favored by exporters usually look after at least one avocado plant of the local variety known to Burundians as \u201camapeter,\u201d in remembrance of Nkurunziza, who died in 2020.\nBut while coffee and tea exports \u2013 Burundi\u2019s traditional sources of much-needed foreign currency \u2013 have long been coordinated, the trade in Burundian avocados has remained unregulated, according to farmer representatives and a trade official. They said that avocado exports could be as profitable for the country as coffee if the government asserted its rule-making authority. \nDesirable measures include guaranteeing a minimum price for farmers, stopping foreign traders from dealing directly with farmers, and encouraging widespread cultivation of the Hass avocados favored by European consumers, they said.\nBurundi \u201ccannot rely only on coffee and tea,\u201d Onesime Niyukuri, an adviser in the foreign trade department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said of the country's limited exports.\nIf avocado dealers from elsewhere in East Africa \u201ccan come and buy at a price that is already set by the government, there is no problem,\u201d he said.\nThe government ramped up its efforts to organize avocado exports earlier this year as dollar shortages fueled sporadic shortages of sugar and other goods. \nUnder new regulations, which require foreign dealers to register with local authorities, exporters must submit copies of their supply contracts and specify market destinations for Burundian avocados, according to the Ministry of Trade, Transport, Industry and Tourism. \nBurundi aims to export more than 10 million tonnes (11 million tons) of avocados each year by 2030, said Niyukuri, citing the government\u2019s strategic plan. Recent figures on Burundi\u2019s foreign exchange earnings from the avocado crop were not readily available.\nThe government\u2019s target is to plant 50,000 avocado trees in each of Burundi\u2019s 17 provinces. Local authorities in provinces such as Kayanza want each household to own at least 10 trees producing exportable avocados. \nThat includes the Mexican variety Fuerte and especially Hass avocado, the most commercially successful variety globally. The fruit, which has dark bumpy skin and bright yellow-green flesh, takes more than two weeks to ripen and can survive several days in transit. \nBurundi, a small mountainous country about the size of Maryland, is home to 13 million people. Annual income per capita was $199 in 2023, among the lowest globally, and nearly 65% of the population lives below the poverty line, according to World Bank figures.\nAgriculture is the main economic activity, and many people in rural provinces such as Kayanza mostly grow the potatoes and vegetables they will consume through the year. For some, including those with a few avocado trees in their compounds, the pear-shaped green fruit has proven a surprisingly reliable source of income.\nEric Nsabimana, a farmer in Kayanza, recalled starting as an avocado grower in response to the campaign of former leader Nkurunziza. Some farmers, feeling forced into planting avocados, uprooted the seedlings the government gave them and now rue the missed opportunity, Nsabimana said. \n\u201cThe people who didn\u2019t plant, they regret,\u201d he said.\nNsabimana, who anticipates making more than $6,000 a year selling avocados now that the price is higher, said he used his earnings to acquire five more hectares (12.4 acres) of land now planted with 500 avocado trees.\nHabimana, the senior official with Green Gold Burundi, said his group moved to mobilize avocado farmers for better rewards after it realized at the beginning of the year they were being exploited by foreign traders.\nOne day in January, he followed a truck transporting Burundian avocados to neighboring Tanzania, believing the cargo was destined for consumption in the region. When he saw the avocados getting washed, weighed and packed in the town of Njombe, he realized the goods were bound for another export market abroad. \n\u201cThere was another destination somewhere else, not in Njombe,\u201d Nsabimana said.\nWhen he returned to Kayanza, Green Gold Burundi prioritized plans to register avocado farmers in a way that eliminated middlemen and guaranteed a reasonable price for farmers. The cooperative pays taxes and keeps a cut of avocado proceeds to sustain operations that include providing members with seedlings and organic manure. \nMunezero, the cooperative's quality management official, said that while the price of avocados \u201cis still a problem,\u201d his group is \u201cfocusing on capacity building\" and encouraging residents to plant more avocado trees. \nGreen Gold Burundi has distributed millions of seedlings in the past year, finding enthusiasm among farmers eager to join the avocado bandwagon. Even growers with only a few backyard Hass plants said they increasingly see avocado as a cash crop. \n\u201cAvocados mean dollars to us,\u201d one such grower, Samuel Niyinyibutsa, said, adding that he knows some Kayanza residents who feel \u201cleft behind\u201d when they see others collect payments for their produce.\n\u201cBut they still have time,\u201d Niyinyibutsa said. \u201cThey can be awakened and start planting avocados because avocado can do well to them as it is doing well to us.\u201d\n___\n"}, {"Source": "https://www.abcnews.go.com", "URL": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/stock-market-today-asian-shares-climb-after-blockbuster-114552440", "Title": "Stock market today: Wall Street slides after Treasury yields climb back above 4% and oil rises", "Author": "N/A", "Date": "October 7, 2024, 12:43 AM", "Content": "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks slid Monday after Treasury yields hit their highest levels since the summer and oil prices continued to climb.The S&P 500 dropped 1%, though it\u2019s still close to its all-time high set a week earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 398 points, or 0.9%, coming off its own record, while the Nasdaq composite sank 1.2%.\nIt\u2019s a stall for U.S. stocks after they rallied to records on relief that interest rates are finally heading back down, now that the Federal Reserve has widened its focus to include keeping the economy humming  instead of just fighting high inflation. Friday\u2019s blowout report on U.S. jobs growth  raised optimism about the economy and hopes that the Fed can pull off a perfect landing for it.\nThe stronger-than-expected hiring pushed Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle to say he now sees just a 15% chance of a recession, down from 20%. \nBut Friday\u2019s jobs report was so strong that it also forced traders to ratchet back forecasts for how much the Fed will ultimately cut interest rates by. That in turn has sent Treasury yields higher, and the 10-year yield is back above 4% for the first time since August.\nThe two-year Treasury yield also briefly climbed back above 4% Monday, up from 3.50% a couple weeks ago. That\u2019s a sizeable move for the bond market, and it can drag on prices for stocks and all kinds of other investments.\nWhen Treasury bonds, which are seen as the safest possible investments, are paying more in interest, investors become less inclined to pay very high prices  for stocks and other things that carry bigger risk of losing money.\nMonday\u2019s sharpest losses hit stocks of utility companies. These kinds of stocks tend to pay big dividends, which means they can see potential buyers leave when bonds are paying more in interest.\nUtilities fell 2.3% for the sharpest loss among the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500 index, including a 5.2% drop for Vistra and a 3.3% slide for Duke Energy. \nIt\u2019s more difficult to look attractive to investors seeking income when a 10-year Treasury is paying a 4.02% yield, up from 3.97% late Friday and from 3.62% three weeks ago.\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, jumped more on Monday. It rose to 3.99% from 3.92% late Friday.\nTreasury yields may also be feeling upward push from the recent jump in oil prices. Crude prices have been spurting higher on worries that worsening tensions in the Middle East  could ultimately lead to disruptions in the flow of oil. \nBrent crude, the international standard, rose another 3.7% Monday to settle at $80.93 per barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, also gained 3.7%, to $77.14 per barrel.\nStocks that are seen as the most expensive can feel the most downward pressure from higher Treasury yields, and the spotlight has been on Big Tech stocks. They drove the majority of the S&P 500\u2019s returns in recent years and soared to heights that critics called overdone.\nApple fell 2.3%, Amazon dropped 3% and Alphabet sank 2.4% to act as some of Monday's heaviest weights on the S&P 500.\nAn exception was Nvidia, which rose another 2.3%. It rode another upswell in excitement about artificial-intelligence technology after Super Micro Computer soared 15.8% after saying it recently shipped more than 100,000 graphics processing units with liquid cooling.\nIf Treasury yields keep rising, companies will likely need to deliver bigger profits to drive their stock prices much higher, and this week marks the start of the latest corporate earnings reporting season.\nAnalysts say earnings per share grew 4.2% during the summer for S&P 500 companies from a year earlier, led by technology and health care companies, according to FactSet. If those analysts are correct, it would be a fifth straight quarter of growth. \nPepsiCo will report its latest quarterly results on Tuesday, but the momentum will really pick up Friday. That\u2019s when JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of New York Mellon will report, as banks dominate the early days of reporting season. \nBank stocks were mixed Monday, with a few adding to gains from Friday when the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised hopes that customers will borrow more money and make good on the loans. \nElsewhere on Wall Street, winemaker Duckhorn Portfolio more than doubled after a private-equity firm said it would buy the company for roughly $1.95 billion in cash.\nAll told, the S&P fell 55.13 points to 5,695.94. The Dow dropped 398.51 to 41,954.24, and the Nasdaq sank 213.95 to 17,923.90.\nIn stock markets abroad, European indexes were mixed following bigger gains in Asia.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index rose 1.8% after the value of the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. A weaker yen can boost profits for Japanese exporters.\nStock markets in mainland China will reopen on Tuesday from a weeklong holiday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. \n___\n"}]
